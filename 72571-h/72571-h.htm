<p class="dcap">The provincial, who knows all
about Central Park and regards
it as the eighth wonder of the
modern world, is more nearly right
than the New Yorker, who is inclined
to take it as a matter of course.
There are comparatively few who
remember the unpromising aspect of
the rocky, swampy waste which,
thirty five years ago, occupied the
midmost portion of Manhattan
Island. The designers of the park
have been so signally successful in
overcoming the difficulties that confronted
them when they took their
task in hand, that the visitor of today
hardly gives them due credit for the
remarkable result, or realizes the vast
expenditure of money, labor, and
skill that has here created the most
beautiful park possessed by any of
the world’s great capitals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus03" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus03.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE CENTRAL PARK MENAGERIE ON A SUMMER AFTERNOON.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For where can Central Park’s
charms be matched? Not beneath
the smoky sky of London, where
vegetation cannot attain anything
like the variety and luxuriance
possible in our clear, pure atmosphere.
Besides, little attempt at
landscape gardening has been made
in any of the parks of the British
metropolis. They may be termed
useful rather than ornamental, and
are valued more for their practical
hygienic effect as breathing spots in
a vast and crowded city than
as fields for the artistic reproduction
of natural beauties. And in Paris,
the <i>allées</i> of the Bois de Boulogne,
prim and formal in their straightness,
lack the charm of Central Park’s
winding drives with their changing
vistas of bordering woodland and
meadow. Philadelphia and Chicago—if
we admit those cities to a comparison—have
parks of larger acreage,
but inferior attractions. Quantity
can never atone for defects of quality.</p>

<p>Central Park is not so very small,
either. It is over half a mile in width,
and more than two and a half miles
in length. It covers 840 acres, which
will hardly compare with Fairmount’s
2740 or the Bois de Boulogne’s 2150,
but is enough to rank it with other
large metropolitan parks, and to afford
ample scope to the various arts
that have contributed to make it what
it is. Londoners call Hyde and
Regent’s Parks large, but their united
extent is but five acres more than
that of Central Park.</p>

<p>Indeed, one of the most wonderful
and attractive features of Central
Park is the skill with which its apparent
size has been magnified. A
stranger driving or walking through
it would never suppose that in his entire
journey he had never been more
than four hundred and fifty yards
away from the streets of New York.
The almost total exclusion of the
outer world, and the production of
effects of distance, are really remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
triumphs of landscape gardening.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus04" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus04.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>ON THE DRIVE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another great charm of Central
Park is the marvelous variety of its
scenery and embellishments. In the
Mall, and especially in the terrace
that leads from it to the lake, we
find the highest development of artificial
decoration. The broad promenade
and the straight avenue of trees,
the work of masons and sculptors,
the plashing fountain and the lake
below—all these combine to produce
the appearance of the garden of some
old French chateau. On the other
hand, on the banks of the Harlem
Mere, in the North Park, sylvan
nature reigns in almost primeval
wildness. Here and there in the
park are broad, level meadows,
divided by stretches of thick wood.
The Ramble, with its labyrinth of
winding paths, its rustic bridge, its
cave, and its miniature water falls, is
an ideal Arcadian spot, while the
lawn tennis ground presents a <i>fin de
siècle</i> contrast. Then there are over
thirty buildings, put to almost as
many different uses, from the monkey
house in the menagerie to the lofty
tower of the Belvedere, which seems
like a picturesque corner of a Rhine
castle. As further evidence of the
amount of work that has been done
to perfect the park, and of the variety
of its contents, it may be stated
that it can boast of nine sheets of
water, forty eight bridges and archways,
nine miles of drives, five miles
of bridle path, and nearly thirty
miles of walks; that it has nineteen
gates, and that over half a million
trees have been set out
within its limits.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp37" id="illus05" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus05.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE OBELISK IN CENTRAL PARK.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The list of statues to be
found in Central Park is
a long and rather curiously
mixed one. Daniel Webster,
Alexander Hamilton,
FitzGreene Halleck, S. F.
B. Morse—these names are
well worthy to be thus
commemorated. It is not
inappropriate that the
marble image of Columbus,
the discoverer of the
New World, should stand
in the chief pleasure ground of its
metropolis. Nor can there be any objection
to the ideal figures—that of
Commerce, the cleverly modeled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Indian Hunter, and the memorial to
the soldiers of the Seventh Regiment
who fell in the civil war.
But strangely enough, all the other
statues in the park are those of
foreigners. The German residents
of New York presented the busts
of Humboldt and Schiller. Citizens
of Italian birth erected the
bust of Mazzini, while sons of stern
Caledonia contributed the statues of
Burns and Scott. From South
America came the equestrian bronze
of Bolivar, and the list of monuments
is completed by those of Shakespeare
and Beethoven. Great men as all these
worthies were, and laudable as is the
desire of their fellow countrymen to
do them honor, it is somewhat unfortunate
that the erection of a
statue in Central Park should have
come to be the recognized method of
giving expression to this feeling. If
the process is continued indefinitely,
the park will become so thickly dotted
with the monuments of foreigners
that the statues of Webster and
Hamilton may have to be removed
to make room for the images of the
deceased poets and scientists of England
and France, Finland and Kamskatka.</p>

<p>Of this tendency to cosmopolitanism
the Mall seems to be headquarters.
Halleck (the poet, not the
general), is the solitary American represented
in its statuary. The visitor
may listen there to imported
music discoursed by a
band principally composed
of imported musicians,
or stroll to the terrace
to admire the most
ambitious ornament of
the park—the Bethesda
fountain, which, although
designed by a New York
artist—Miss Emma Stebbins—was
modeled in
Rome and cast in Munich.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp48" id="illus06" style="max-width: 28.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus06.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>IN THE NORTH PARK—A SOLITARY STROLL.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In its vegetation, too,
Central Park has a cosmopolitan
tone. Much
has been done to make it
a sort of Jardin d’Acclimatation
for the trees
and shrubs indigenous to
other climes. The commissioners’
efforts in this
direction have had good
results in varying its
flora with exotics whose
foliage or flowers make
them pleasing to the eye
as well as interesting to
the botanist. They have
not always been equally
fortunate, however, and
have been criticised for
an apparent partiality to
foreign trees in preference
to natives of sturdier
growth and better
suited to the climate.
It is not every European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
plant that will flourish here. For
instance, six years ago a splendid
row of English hawthorn bushes
lined a long stretch of the park’s
western edge between Sixtieth and
Seventieth Streets, and in May bore a
wealth of the white blossoms that
take their name from the month.
They are there no more, killed by
the severity of our winters.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp58" id="illus07" style="max-width: 34.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus07.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>AN AFTERNOON GATHERING ON THE MALL.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Asia, and especially Japan, have
contributed some valuable additions
to Central Park’s woods and shrubbery.
The most conspicuous of these
is the Rose of Sharon, whose pink
and white blossoms are the park’s
chief floral ornament in the latter
days of summer—for it is in spring
that most of the other shrubs and
creepers flower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>In the spring, indeed, Central
Park reaches its acme of natural
beauty and artificial attraction. In
the spring its drives are thronged
by the equipages of the Four Hundred
who later in the year are
scattered over two or three continents.
In the spring the trees and
meadows are clothed with a fresh
garb of green, and the Park policeman
in a new suit of gray, the
cynosure of admiring nursemaids.
In the spring the wistaria, the honeysuckle,
the jasmine, and the guelder
rose make the landscape gay with
color. In the spring the dogwood,
the most beautiful and characteristic
of our lesser trees, sends down its
falling petals in a snow white
shower. In the spring the New
Yorker may be pardoned if for once
he feels positively poetical as he witnesses
in Central Park the annual
miracle of nature’s rejuvenation.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus08" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus08.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE STRAIT BETWEEN THE UPPER AND LOWER LAKES.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But more observers’ eyes, probably,
are turned upon the driveways and
their wonderful parade of vehicles
than upon the panorama of wood
and meadow. Such a sight as the
wheeled procession that pours
through the entrance at Fifty Ninth
Street and Fifth Avenue cannot be
found elsewhere in America, and is
indeed only matched by the displays
of Rotten Row and the Champs
Elysées. Other American cities admittedly
look to New York as their
leader and mentor in the matter of
fine horseflesh and smart equipages.
The very latest and handsomest products
of the carriage builders’ skill
are here to be seen whirling along
behind teams whose value represents
a small fortune. There comes the
banker’s victoria, drawn by a pair of
horses whose clock-like gait and well
fed aspect of sleekness show that
they appreciate their position in the
establishment to which they belong.
Behind this comes a trim, light
phaeton; then a family party in a
barouche; these predominating types
of vehicle being interspersed with
the tall and ostentatious four in
hand, the more unconventional buckboard,
the natty dogcart, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
democratic park coach, whose passengers
take in all the beauties of
the scene at twenty five cents a trip.</p>

<p>The bridle path, too, on a sunny
afternoon in May, is a spectacle to be
remembered. Its pictures come and
pass more swiftly than those of the
drive, where moderation of speed is
a necessity, and is promptly enforced,
in the rare cases of its infraction, by
the mounted policemen. And, by
the way, these sublimated graycoats
are themselves worthy of a second
glance. Their animals are a really
beautiful and well groomed set—most
of them bays—and the riders’
horsemanship is of such uniform
excellence that a stranger in the park
can hardly distinguish one member
of the mounted force from another.
And in their patrol over fourteen
miles of driveway and bridle path
their duty is by no means a sinecure.
Their courage and promptitude have
often been tried by the accidents
caused from time to time by untrained
horses or reckless or inexperienced
drivers and riders. At the season
and the hour when it is most frequented,
the bridle path is no place
for the careless or unskilled horseman.
As much space has been given
to it as can well be spared, but its
width is so comparatively small that
at some of the bends serious
accidents might easily occur. The
rule against riding more than
two abreast is a highly necessary
one.</p>

<p>The separation of the drives
and the bridle paths is a point
in which convenience has been
subordinated to other considerations.
If they lay close together
throughout their length, instead
of winding through the park on
wholly divergent lines, the enjoyment
of both riders and drivers
would be increased. A radical
alteration in the plan of the park,
however, would be necessary to
effect such a change.</p>

<p>Nearly a quarter of Central
Park is occupied by its various
bodies of water. These have
their ornamental and their practical
side. The latter is of course
represented by the reservoirs that receive
the principal portion of the
water supply brought down by the
Croton aqueduct. There is a smaller
double basin (now being deepened)
in the center of the park opposite
Eightieth Street, overlooked by the
Belvedere, and the main reservoir that
fills nearly the whole of the space between
Eighty Sixth and Ninety Sixth
Streets, and forms the division between
the North Park and the South
Park. That this big pond, pretty
nearly half a mile in length and in
width, adds nothing to the attractions
of the park, few who have walked or
ridden along its border will maintain.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp78" id="illus09" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus09.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>CHILDREN AND NURSES IN THE PARK.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of the ornamental waters the Lake—so
called <i>par excellence</i>—is the chief.
The effect with which irregularity of
outline may be used to add to apparent
size is well exemplified by comparing
this with the reservoir. Take
a boat on the upper part of the Lake,
near the foot of the Terrace, row
under the bridge across the strait
into its lower expanse, and continue
to the furthest extremity of the
creeks that open into it, and you will
hardly guess that the whole sheet of
water measures but twenty acres,
while the Croton reservoir covers
more than a hundred. You will also
be likely to think that you have
found a remarkably pleasant place for
a row, especially if your expedition is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
made in the dusk of a summer evening,
when the red lanterns that glow
dimly in the bows of the boats make
a picturesque scene which is often
pronounced to be “just like Venice”
by those who have never been in that
city of watery streets.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus10" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus10.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A “TALLY HO” IN CENTRAL PARK—THE FAVORITE VEHICLE OF THE JEUNESSE DORÉE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The other lakes are the Pond, near
the Fifty Ninth Street entrance, on
which ply the swan boats; the Conservatory
water near Fifth Avenue
and opposite Seventy Fourth Street;
and three in the North Park—Harlem
Mere, in the northwestern corner, and
the two miniature lakelets called the
Pool and the Lock.</p>

<p>The swan boats are by no means
the park’s only attraction especially
designed for children. There are the
swings and merry-go-round of the
carrousel, and the little carriages
that are drawn up and down the Mall
by well trained goats. The menagerie,
too, is a source of never failing
wonder and amusement. There
is always a crowd, in which young
people predominate, watching the
monkeys, gazing with something like
awe at Tip, the huge elephant who
has murdered more than one of his
keepers, or throwing peanuts and
similar esculents to the more docile
pachyderm whose quarters are in the
neighboring cage.</p>

<p>The enjoyment of the children
would be greater yet if the grass
covered lawns were not forbidden
territory to them. In a few places,
indeed, they are allowed to play upon
nature’s green carpet, and the privilege
might well be extended without
injury to the park.</p>

<p class="dcap">Of the two great divisions of the
drama, tragedy is today surprisingly
similar to what it was in
the days of the ancient Greeks,
while comedy has in the mean time
been the subject of a remarkable
evolution. That evolution has proceeded
with especial rapidity within
recent years. To find the best and
noblest exemplifications of tragedy
we have to go back two centuries to
the master works of Shakespeare. A
few exceptional comedies there are
of Sheridan’s or Goldsmith’s, whose
popularity has not diminished with
the lapse of time, though many
generations have come and gone
since they were penned. But they
may be counted upon the fingers of
a single hand, and only serve to emphasize
the rarity of comedies that
can hold the boards for more than
a few seasons.</p>

<p>The development of comedy, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
especially of its more farcical
branches, is, indeed, the chief feature
of recent dramatic history. Attribute
it to a reaction from the increased
tension of modern business life, or
assign what sociological cause you
will, the fact remains that the general
demand is for plays whose aim
and object is to amuse. It cannot be
maintained that this tendency is restricted
to the less educated class
of theater goers. On the contrary,
it is at houses that are especially frequented
by people of wealth and
fashion that the supremacy of
comedy is most assured. Melodrama
is still the most drawing card in the
theaters patronized by the lower
million.</p>

<p>The advance of comedy has been
multiform. Farces of greater ingenuity
and more sustained brilliance
of workmanship are written by the
playwrights of today than by their
forerunners. They are interpreted
upon the boards by more finished
artists, and with a stage setting that
constantly becomes more complete
and costly. The comedian has a
higher professional and even social
standing now than a generation ago,
and he may secure a much greater
degree of renown, with its financial
accompaniment of ample earnings.
And all this arises from the workings
of the old law of supply and demand.
Every art that can contribute
to the embellishment of its
presentation becomes the handmaid
of comedy. Music is pressed into
its service, and the result is that
characteristic phase of latter day
theatricals, the burletta.</p>

<p>There was a time, and not so very
long ago, when the predecessors of
Francis Wilson and De Wolf Hopper
were set down as “low comedians,”
and relegated to an artistic
rank slightly superior to that of the
circus clown. Every one knows the
contrast in the position of the modern
apostles of Momus. Attend the
theaters, read the newspapers, listen
to the comment of the club rooms,
and you will speedily be convinced
that they are the theatrical lions of the
hour, that among all the constellations
of the dramatic firmament their
planet is in the ascendant. Nor is
there anything in this state of affairs
to justify the pessimistic philosopher
in an outcry against the alleged decadence
of the stage. The popular
taste for comedy is neither a degraded
nor a perverted one, and the
success of its leading exponents has
been won upon their merits.</p>

<p>The comic star rises to the zenith
by an ascent as difficult and laborious
as that which leads to high rank in
any other profession. <i>Ars est celare
artem</i>, and the apparently easy spontaneity
with which he develops the
humor of a stage situation is the
fruit of conscientious study and persistent
practice. There are no more
painstaking actors than the two
typical burlesquers who as the
Regent of Siam and the Merry
Monarch have during the recent
months reigned successively at the
Broadway Theater, New York.</p>

<p>Francis Wilson, who recently succeeded
his brother potentate, has
worked his way up from the lowest
rounds of the theatrical ladder. His
first appearance was with Sandford’s
minstrel company in a sketch called
“The Brians,” which was played in
Philadelphia. Young as he was—only
a boy in his teens—Wilson made
something of a hit. This was enough
to secure him plenty of remunerative
engagements with minstrel troupes,
as a member of which he traveled all
over the country. He was ambitious,
however, for work of a higher order,
and to secure a foothold upon the
legitimate stage he undertook a
minor part in a company that appeared
at the Chestnut Street
Theater, in Philadelphia. Here
again his talents declined to conceal
themselves under a bushel. In the
role of <i>Lamp</i>, a broken down actor
in “Wild Oats,” he carried with him
upon the stage an old foil, the last
relic of better days, and from this
seemingly unpromising article he
managed to extract so much quiet
humor that the audience was convulsed
and the star of the piece
entered a formal complaint at this
interference with his supremacy.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>DE WOLF HOPPER.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The following years saw the young
actor steadily advancing in his art,
but experiencing various ups and
downs of fortune, which wound up
with the “stranding” of his company,
Mitchell’s Pleasure Party, in
San Francisco. Next he reappeared
in Philadelphia—let us hope that he
was not obliged to reach it on foot—as
a member of the McCaull
troupe, with which he played in his
first comic opera, “The Queen’s
Lace Handkerchief.”</p>

<p>From this point his career has
been one of uncheckered prosperity.
He was speedily recognized as a
comic opera star of no ordinary
luster. In such standard parts as
that of <i>Cadeaux</i> in Erminie he achieved
a reputation and a popularity that
finally led him to organize a company
of his own, with which he has
even eclipsed his previous successes
in “The Oolah” and “The Merry
Monarch.”</p>

<p>De Wolf Hopper’s popularity has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
been won still more rapidly than
that of his brother comedian. He is
the youngest of our successful actors,
as well as one of the most
original in his methods, but he has
been upon the boards long enough
to gain a thorough dramatic training
and a varied experience. It was
his enthusiasm for private theatricals,
and his success in them, that led
him upon the professional stage—in
spite of the fact that he had been
educated for the law. He was only
twenty when, in 1880, he appeared
as the leading spirit of the Criterion
Comedy Company, which had a fair
measure of prosperity, presenting
such standard plays as “Caste” and
“Our Boys.” When it disbanded he
was successively with Edward Harrigan
in “The Blackbird,” and at the
Madison Square Theater under the
management of Daniel Frohman. At
this latter house, in the parts of
<i>Pittacus Green</i> in “Hazel Kirke,” and
<i>Oliver Hathaway</i> in “May Blossom,”
he gained the approbation of metropolitan
theater goers to a degree
that was greatly enhanced during
the next five years, which he passed
as a member of the McCaull opera
company. His last season with that
organization was marked by a success
as <i>Casimir</i> in “Clover” that
showed an advance upon anything he
had previously done. “Wang,”
which was so notably well received
at the Broadway Theater during the
past summer, was his first independent
venture.</p>

</figure>

<p>There are those who cherish the
idea that the continued success of
actors like Messrs. Wilson and Hopper
is largely due to the prestige of
their reputation and the indulgence
shown by the public toward established
favorites. They tell us that
it matters little what may be the
merits of the piece or its staging,
the star is sure to have a following
sufficient to fill the box office with a
golden stream. He might almost as
well dispense with the libretto altogether,
they say, for as soon as he
opens his lips to speak the audience
roars with laughter.</p>

<p>So far as it denies the necessity for
care and labor, thought and skill, in
the preparation and presentation of
a farce, this theory is fundamentally
mistaken. It has again and again
been proved that no names upon the
playbill, however eminent, can make
a poor play successful. The theater
going public may not be infallible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
but it is too discriminating to accept
an unpalatable article because it
bears a title of repute. The later popularity
of “The Oolah” has obliterated
recollection of the fact that on
its first night its reception was not
enthusiastic. The critics thought
and said that Wilson had made a
mistake. But the comedian set himself
at work to improve the piece,
cutting here, adding there, and interlining
and changing until in a
hundred small but yet not unimportant
points it was a different and a
better play. This is merely a single
example of those expenditures of
thought and care that escape the
hasty critic, and many similar incidents
might be cited. For instance,
the remarkably flexible voice of
which De Wolf Hopper makes such
effective use has received almost as
careful training as a prima donna’s.</p>

<p>It would hardly be fair to the
theatrical situation of the day to
picture it only as a regime of farce
comedy. The burlesque is indeed
the most characteristic phase of the
<i>fin de siècle</i> dramatic development,
but it is not by any means sole monarch
of the stage. The avenue that
leads to the applause of the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
of culture is still open to interpreters
of the art that can call forth tears as
well as laughter.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>MODJESKA AS JULIE DE MORTIMER.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>No better proof of this can be
given than the marked favor with
which Madame Modjeska has been
everywhere received during her comparatively
brief career upon the
American stage. It is true that she
had already gained a wide reputation
in Europe when she abandoned
her profession and came to the
New World with her husband, Count
Bozenta. They had in view the
establishment of a colony of their
Polish fellow countrymen in Southern
California. The scheme was probably
somewhat Utopian. At any rate it
was abandoned, and the countess,
under her earlier name of Modjeska,
fitted herself for the English speaking
stage.</p>

<p>San Francisco was the scene of
her debut, and “Adrienne Lecouvreur”
the play. She has since acted
in all the leading cities of America,
besides making two visits to London.
Her repertory includes a wide range
of pieces of the highest intellectual
order. As a delineator of Shaksperian
heroines she is unsurpassed,
and her appearances with Edwin
Booth in the great dramatic classics
have been among the most notable
events of recent seasons. The intensity
of her <i>Juliet</i>, the grace and
dignity of her <i>Portia</i>, the pathos
of her <i>Ophelia</i>, and the Arcadian
<i>naïveté</i> of her <i>Rosalind</i> have
borne witness to her rare endowment
of histrionic talent. Among
other plays in which she has taken
the leading part are “Camille,”
“Mary Stuart,” “Juanna,” “Frou-Frou,”
“Odette,” and “Richelieu.”
In the last named, which she played
in conjunction with Booth, she scored
one of her most notable successes
as <i>Julie de Mortimer</i>.</p>

<p>Long as she has been upon the
stage of two continents, Madame
Modjeska’s impersonations of <i>Juliet</i>
or <i>Beatrice</i> have all the fresh charm
of youth. With exceptional skill in
the portrayal of strong emotion she
combines a lightness of touch and a
graceful refinement that are peculiarly
characteristic. The fact that she
has never succeeded in removing from
her English speech the last faint
trace of a foreign accent, is to many
of her parts rather an added interest
than a blemish.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_DAUGHTER_OF_THE_DESERT">A DAUGHTER OF THE DESERT.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By Thomas Winthrop Hall.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dcap">A tired horse ambled slowly up
to the solitary adobe house, or
rather hut, that meets the sight of the
dusty traveler who journeys between
a certain station on the Southern
Pacific railroad and the famous
Indian station at San Carlos. One
hundred miles of dusty road that
wound over a naked, sandy plain
sparsely dotted with hideous cactus,
a stretch of the desert on either side,
and on the horizon walls of gray
mountains treeless as the desert
itself—these were the uncheerful
surroundings of McCoy’s ranch.
Worse than a prison, more remote
than a Siberian mine, lonelier than the
grave, here two human souls, father
and daughter, had lived for more
than twelve years, and during that
twelve years they had been away
from that adobe oasis, the girl at
least, not one single day, and the
father never longer than it would
take him to ride over to the mountains
for a short hunt. It was a
watering station on the stage road.
An artesian well had been sunk there
in the early days. Like every other
work of man it had to have its
human slaves, and from the day the
last adobe had been laid these slaves
had been McCoy and his daughter
Sis. The latter was a child of six
when she was lifted out of the ox
wagon at the door of the house. She
was now a girl of eighteen.</p>

<p>What a life hers had been! One
unvarying monotony of cooking and
of washing, of chopping wood and
feeding the horses and of looking
anxiously one day up the road for the
stage to come down and the next day
down the road for the stage to come
up so that she might have dinner (a
pretentious name for a meal that
consisted always of bacon, eggs,
coffee and hot bread) prepared for
the stage driver and what unfortunate
companions in misery he might
be transporting to or from the
agency. These, alas, gulped down
their food as hastily as possible and
hastened away at once, only too
anxious to get the thing over with.
That was all she saw of them. Once
in a while she caught sight of a
muffled figure in an ambulance that
stopped for water for its thirsty
mules and knew that it was a woman
because it did not get out and swear
at the heat and dust, an officer’s wife
probably—ah! how she longed to
speak to her. The rough freighters
often camped there. This was the
sum total of the girl’s experience
with beings of her kind save one.</p>

<p>That was the man who sat carelessly
erect on the tired horse that
ambled up to the adobe house.
Lieutenant Jack Harding was he, of
Uncle Sam’s —th regiment of
cavalry. And what a man he was, to
be sure! Handsome as a Greek god,
stalwart as a Norse warrior, reckless,
brave, accomplished, as gentle as a
girl until aroused, then as wild and
defiant as an Apache, he was a
Bayard in the eyes of most women
and a demi-god in the estimation of
poor Sis. He had stopped over night
at the watering station six times in
four years. Sis dreamed of his coming
months before he appeared, and
dreamed, too, of his going months
after he went. She worshiped him
from the moment she first saw him.
That was all. She had read many
books, for her father had taught her
to read, and Jack Harding served in
turn as the hero of each novel she
became possessed of, and, of course,
(O dear little trait of woman’s nature)
she as the heroine.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Jack jumped from his
horse as lightly as though a ride of
fifty miles were a mere bagatelle,
and walked smilingly up to the door.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Just as he reached it Sis came bashfully
to the doorway.</p>

<p>“Hello, Sis,” said the lieutenant
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“O——,” replied Sis. She never
could talk to him.</p>

<p>“Dad home?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Hunting?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve come to make my
party call for the last time I was
here. Got anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Only bacon and eggs.”</p>

<p>“Good enough for a prince—if the
prince is as hungry as I am. All
right, get them ready. I’ll go and
take care of Noche. Come, Noche—want
some water, old girl?” He
led off the horse, and Sis turned
from the doorway to the kitchen.
As she did so she stepped just for
one moment into a little room that,
were she a lady, she would call her
boudoir, though it was but little
larger than a good sized piano box,
and looked searchingly at her own
face in a bit of broken looking glass.
What did she see? No thing of
beauty, I assure you. This girl had
not been dowered by God with that
divine gift that makes every woman
who possesses it a queen. Far from it.
But so ignorant of the world was
she, so much an utter stranger to
the appearance of others of her sex,
that she did not know that she was
remarkably homely. Freckle faced,
pug nosed, red haired, rough and
worn with work, she was in appearance
positively ugly. She had often
asked her father whether or not she
was good looking, and he had invariably
replied “Yes.” But he
always said it in such a way that
poor Sis began at last to suspect that
she was not really as beautiful as the
heroines of Scott’s novels (she knew
the descriptions of them by heart.)
Still it might be, and she hoped—a
thing that a woman does almost as
easily as she forgives.</p>

<p>The supper was eaten in the usual
wondering silence on her part and
the running fire of nonsense on the
part of the lieutenant. He accused
her of being in love with “Peg-leg,”
the mule driver, and was cheerfully
unconscious of the fact that his
words tortured her heart until she
almost broke down and cried before
him. He told her all the news of the
post and the latest jokes on the officers
in an endeavor—a vain one—to
make her laugh. People who
have lived ten years in a desert do
not laugh. At last it was over, and
she cleared away and washed the
dishes. He smoked his pipe the
while, wondering how in the world
she came to be so homely, wondering
how she managed to exist in such
a place, and coming to a mental conclusion
as to how long he himself
could stand such a life before committing
suicide. Then he went out
and took a stroll on the sandy desert.
Old McCoy was not in sight,
and though it was moonlight it was
hardly probable that he would return
that night. He congratulated
himself, too, that Sis had not been
brought up to the ideas of good society,
else he would have to make his
bed in the hay that night and leave the
house, double barred and locked, to
Sis. He even thoughtlessly muttered
to himself, “What a wonderful
protection a homely face is!”
Then he went back to the kitchen to
talk to Sis a while before going to bed.
As he entered a sight met his astonished
eyes that almost made him burst
with laughter. It was nothing more
nor less than Sis arrayed in a gown
that would have been an absurdity
in caricature. Green satin trimmed
with red ribbons and a red sash,
formless, shapeless, it was her pitiful
attempt to appear beautiful. Her
great hands hung from the sleeves
like baskets from the branches of
an apple tree. Her red face and hair
looked redder still by the contrast
with the gaudy colors of the dress,
and she stood in the habitual slouching
attitude so characteristic of her.
Yet there was something in her gray
eyes that told him it was a supreme
moment in her life—the wearing of
this dress—and he did not laugh.
Indeed, for a moment he almost felt
sad. He tried to sit down as unconcernedly
as possible, and busied
himself filling his pipe. He did not
dare to look at her. He hoped she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
would do something or say something,
but she did not. She stood
there silent, intense, looking at him
so earnestly that it was but too
manifest that she was trying to read
his thoughts. He must do something.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that dress,
Sis?” he said as quietly as he could.</p>

<p>“Dad gave it to me,” she answered.
“He always promised me a
satin dress, and so last Christmas he
sent and got the satin. I made it.
This is the first time I have worn it
before any one.”</p>

<p>She spoke as though the words
were choking her. She seemed to be
nerving herself for something unusual.
She was.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she cried, almost fiercely,
“tell me honestly, am I beautiful?”</p>

<p>He tried not to do it. He felt like
a cur, a second afterwards, for having
done it. But he could not help
it, do what he could to control himself.
He laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“O don’t—don’t—don’t——” she
almost screamed. Then she fell on
the floor in a green and red heap
and wept. Jack had seen women
weep before (a number of them had
wept at different times when he had
come to say “good by”), but never
before had he seen such a torrent of
tears as this. There was no stemming
it, though he tried very hard.
It seemed an age before it ceased,
and then it seemed another age that
she sat there motionless with her face
in her hands as though she was trying
to hide it. He felt horribly nervous.
It took him sixteen matches,
as he afterwards said, to smoke one
pipe. Finally she broke the silence.
Her voice was calm enough as she
asked:</p>

<p>“What is a beautiful woman
like?”</p>

<p>He did not answer in words. It
was just a little hard to speak at all.
He unbuttoned his blouse and took
from the inside pocket a photograph
and handed it to her. She held it
fiercely in her two great rough hands
and gazed at it steadily for a long
time. Poor woman, she learned what
beauty was, and she learned of the
love of this man whom she worshiped.
Then she got up, handed
back the photograph to its owner
and walked silently and slowly from
the room.</p>

<p>It was hard for Jack Harding to
sleep that night. He got into a fitful
slumber along towards morning, and
he had not been sleeping for an hour
when he found himself standing
awake in the middle of the room
feeling for his revolver in the gray
light of the early dawn.</p>

<p>“Nothing but a shot could wake
me like that,” he said to himself, and
hastily pulling on his clothes and
taking his revolver in his hand he
went through the house. The fire
had been built and breakfast, already
cooked, was waiting for him. “I
guess Sis didn’t sleep much either,”
he thought. He knocked at her
door but received no answer. “Milking
the cow, I guess,” he thought, but
there was beginning to be a horrible
dread in his heart. He ran hastily
out of the house, and there—there
under his own window lay Sis, again
a green and red heap, but there was
red on the dress now that was not
ribbon. She had shot herself in the
breast. He ran to her and picked her
up. He carried her into the house
and swore at himself for never having
had the energy to study a little surgery
in all the long years of his
army idleness. Presently she revived
a little and he heard her
murmur faintly: “Tell dad good
by—tell him I can’t help him any
longer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sis!” he pleaded, “why did
you do this?”</p>

<p>“Because you laughed at me,” she
answered.</p>

<p>“But I did not mean it. You are
beautiful, Sis, indeed you are very
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, I’m not,” she said. “I know
what beauty is now.”</p>

<p>He could say nothing for a time.
He hardly knew why he said what
he did when he spoke.</p>

<p>“Sis,” he asked her gently, “tell
me, why did you want to be beautiful?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“Because—because I loved you,”
she answered slowly and with a
sob.</p>

<p>And when her father got home that
afternoon and walked gayly into the
little adobe house, he found them
still together, one dead—one weeping.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The completion of
the new building
of the American
Museum of Natural
History
marks the second
step toward the
realization of one
of the most colossal schemes ever
formed for the promotion of
science. The plan will not be fully
carried out until the whole of Manhattan
Square, on a part of which
the present edifice stands, is covered
with a structure of imposing extent
and immense capacity, which is to
become the great headquarters of
natural science on this continent, and
to rank on at least an equality with
any similar institution in the world.</p>

<p>Natural history is a department of
knowledge that should be of especial
interest to the inhabitants of a country
where nature displays her wonders
on so tremendous a scale and
her riches in such exhaustless variety.
And indeed America’s contributions
to that branch of science
have already been great. Of this
the names of Alexander Wilson,
Charles Lucien Bonaparte, James E.
DeKay, James Dwight Dana, and
others no less noteworthy, will serve
as sufficient evidence.</p>

<p>Scientific societies were among the
earliest developments of American
intellectual life, and in our leading
cities they have received a constant
and growing support. Oldest of all
is the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia,
which issued scientific works
as long ago as 1769. In 1780 the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences was organized in Boston,
and in 1812 the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Science began
its useful existence. New York was
later in entering the field. The
Lyceum of Natural History, the germ
of the present establishment, was
originated in 1817. In 1869 its collections
were destroyed by fire, but the
disaster proved to be the beginning
of its expansion. Some prominent
and public spirited members of the
society, realizing the importance of
securing for it safer and more extended
quarters, took steps to establish
it upon a broader basis as one of
the recognized institutions of the
metropolis. The American Museum
of Natural History was incorporated
by the Legislature, and an ample
and well situated plot of ground,
covering four entire city blocks, was
assigned to its use by the municipal
park department, which has also
paid for the erection and maintenance
of the museum building.</p>

<p>Of the immense structure designed
by the incorporators of the museum,
an interior wing, about one twentieth
part of the whole mass, was the first
erected. The corner stone was laid
by President Grant in June, 1874,
and the building was opened in
December, 1877. Its external appearance
is by no means unattractive,
although in its design architectural
beauty was subordinated to practical
considerations of light and arrangement.
Its collections are displayed
in three great halls, one of which has
its floor space almost doubled by a
capacious balcony. Above these is
an attic story, containing the library
of the institution and a number of
chambers set apart as lecture rooms,
laboratories, and the like.</p>

</figure>

<p>The board walk that runs diagonally
from Seventy Seventh Street and
Central Park to Eighty First Street
and Columbus Avenue—the two
points at which visitors usually
approach the museum—passes, midway,
the present entrance, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
unpretentious aspect is a most decided
contrast to the solid magnificence
of the newly finished front. It
leads directly to the first great hall,
on the ground floor, which is mainly
occupied by the Jesup collection of
American woods. This is an assemblage
of specimens of trees indigenous
to North America, wonderfully
complete and well arranged.
Each is cut so as to display the bark
and the polished and unpolished
timber, with a colored map that
shows at a glance the geographical
distribution of the species. In most
instances an entire section of the
trunk is exhibited, and on the west
side of the hall there are two colossal
specimens, worthy to serve as round
tables for King Arthur, which may
prompt the unobservant visitor to
exclaim, “Those must be the Big
Trees of California!” Such is not
the case, though both of them hail
from the Pacific coast, being
respectively the Yellow and the
Sugar Pine. A specimen of the
<i>Sequoia gigantea</i> is in an adjoining
case, where it attracts less attention
because it is but a comparatively
small fragment of the trunk of one
of those famous monarchs of the
vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>In the same hall, in cases that
stand along the center of the room
and in the window alcoves, are some
bird groups that receive a plentiful
share of admiration. They deserve
it, for as specimens of accurate and
artistic taxidermy they have rarely
been equaled and never excelled.
They reproduce feathered life and
its surroundings with a fidelity that
bespeaks thorough knowledge, remarkable
skill, and almost infinite
patience. There are birds in every
attitude—perching, swimming, walking,
and even flying—each in a
setting that very picturesquely
shows its habitation and habits. The
uninitiated visitor can hardly persuade
himself that the foliage, the
herbage, and the flowers that he sees
through the glass can be the imperishable
product of an artificer’s
ingenuity, and not the work of
nature herself. Some of the best of
the groups are the robins, with their
nest among the pink blossomed
apple boughs; the grebes, swimming
in a happy family upon a glassy imitation
of water; the laughing gulls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
with their nest in the bent grass; the
Louisiana water thrush, domiciled
under an overhanging bank; the cat
birds, the clapper rails, and the
ruffed grouse, these last so life-like
that the visitor can almost fancy he
hears the brown leaves rustle beneath
the feet of the chickens. Great
credit is due to Jenness Richardson,
the museum’s chief taxidermist, and
Mrs. E. S. Mogridge, who jointly
prepared this beautiful series of exhibits.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE BELLA BELLA INDIAN WAR CANOE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A specimen that calls for a word
of notice, as one of the most valuable
in the museum, stands on the
right hand side of the entrance to
this lower hall. It is an awkward
looking bird of medium size, dark
plumage, and disproportionately
large bill, and its label designates
it as the Great Auk. It is, in fact,
one of the very few extant relics of
a species that has within the memory
of living man disappeared from
the earth. There are but three
others in this country—one in the
National Museum at Washington,
one in the Philadelphia Academy of
Natural Science, and one in the collection
belonging to Vassar College.
The money value of a specimen of
such rarity is hard to fix precisely,
but it undoubtedly runs into the
thousands of dollars.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="illus21" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus21.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A DETHRONED IDOL.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The second floor—the main story
of the building—is principally devoted
to cases of stuffed birds. These
multitudinous rows of single specimens,
each perched upon its neat
stand of cherry wood, are, of course,
less picturesque than the grouped
figures, but are nevertheless of great
interest and value. The martial
aspect of the eagles, the curious
structure of the pelicans and secretary
birds, and the bright plumage
of the flamingoes, the peacocks, and
the argus pheasant attract attention
and admiration.</p>

<p>Here, too, are the osseous remains
of the late lamented Jumbo, to whom
has fallen the rare privilege of
achieving a double immortality; for
while his pachydermatous hide,
stuffed with straw, is still a feature
of the “Greatest Show on Earth,”
his skeleton stands majestically on
the visitor’s right hand as he enters
the second hall of the museum. Sea
lions, walruses and other marine
monsters are also to be found on
this floor, besides a few stuffed
groups. One of these last shows a
family of screech owls, with their
nest deep in a hollow tree. Another—one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
of the best in the museum—represents
a scene in the tree tops of
Borneo, and includes five fine specimens
of the orang-utan, or Wild Man
of the Woods, the great simian that
disputes with the African chimpanzee
and gorilla, the honor of being
the brute’s nearest approach to man.
Playing among the branches and
eating the fruit of the durian, we see
here a group that shows the orang-utan
(we follow the spelling adopted
by the museum) at various periods
of its life and growth. There are a
baby, a young female, a full grown
male, and two veterans—one of
either sex—with long, black hair
and hideously wrinkled faces.</p>

<p>Ascending to the gallery above,
we find a large and varied collection
of implements of savage tribes and
relics of prehistoric man. A huge
case of skulls, whose owners lived
and breathed thousands of years ago,
is a ghastly reminder of the continuity
of human history. Implements
of stone and flint from
France, from Denmark, and from
the Mississippi valley are silent witnesses
of the days before the discovery
of the art of working iron.
There are also a couple of notable
groups—one of opossums and one of
muskrats. The latter is a singularly
faithful reproduction of nature. It
shows a muskrat swimming by the
bank of a pond, whose glassy surface
is blurred by the ripples that mark
his course. White and yellow lilies
float on the water, from which rises a
muskrat house, opened at the side
to show one of its inmates lunching
upon a reed stem. The sandy bank
of the pond is pierced by galleries
from which there peeps a young rat.</p>

<p>From the ceiling, in the center of
the hall, there hangs a huge Indian
war canoe, which once bore the warriors
of the Bella Bella tribe, in
British Columbia, over the waters of
Queen Charlotte’s Sound. Though
capacious enough to carry a small
regiment, it was made from the wood
of a single tree.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus22.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE MASTODON—AN EXTINCT INHABITANT OF NORTH AMERICA.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The third floor of the museum is
devoted to collections of shells and
minerals, which include a wealth of
interesting specimens. There is a
sheet of itacolumite, or flexible
sandstone, from North Carolina, so
arranged that its power of bending
can be tested by turning a screw;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
there are stibnite (antimony ore)
from Japan, galenite (lead ore) from
Missouri, gold quartz from California,
calamine from New Jersey,
as well as chalcopyrite, marcasite,
and a host of other minerals of
strange name and form. On one
small tray are grouped reproductions
of the world’s most famous
diamonds, showing the exact size
and appearance of these little pebbles
for which dynasties have been
overthrown. One of them is labeled
“the Koh-i-noor, value $1,000,000.”
It is safe to say that Queen Victoria
is not offering the original for sale at
that price. And if the Koh-i-noor,
which weighs 125 karats, is worth a
million, what must be the value of
the Great Mogul diamond, of 297
karats?</p>

<p>Further down the same row of
cases are amethysts, beryls, agates,
and other semi-precious stones.
Among these is a curious section of
an agatized tree from Chalcedony
Park, Arizona. It was mineralized
by the waters of a hot silicated
spring, the silica replacing the
wood as it decayed, particle by
particle.</p>

<p>In the center of the hall stands a
remarkably perfect skeleton of a
mastodon, the huge prehistoric
elephant that once roamed over Europe
and North America. This
specimen was found in a peaty
swamp near Newburgh, New York,
in 1879. Compared with the bony
framework of Jumbo on the floor below—the
two monsters were separated,
perhaps, in order to prevent
jealousy between them—the mastodon
is shorter in stature, but considerably
longer. He stands 8 feet
5 inches from the ground, while his
length “over all” is 18 feet, and his
immense curved tusks measure 7
feet 5 inches. Near the entrance
there is the skeleton of a moa, the
great extinct ostrich of New Zealand,
and at the further end of the
hall that of another animal that existed
in the dawn of man’s history—the
great Irish elk, found in a peat
bog near Limerick.</p>

<p>The raised map of New Hampshire,
which stands in an alcove on
the left hand side of the entrance,
is the product of an immensity of
care and labor. It is constructed to
a scale of a mile to the inch, the elevation
being exaggerated about five
times, or to a scale of a thousand
feet to the inch. It is a good illustration
of the value of this sort of
map in giving a graphic and comprehensive
idea of the topographical
and geological formation of a country.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus23.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A SCREECH OWL FAMILY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the wall on the other end of
the hall are two large tablets of
triassic rock from Massachusetts,
showing the foot prints—or “au-toe-graphs,”
as James Russell Lowell
once ventured to call them—of some
huge reptile, and of tiny insects and
shellfish.</p>

<p>Throughout his inspection of the
museum’s contents, the visitor will
have noticed that every inch of available
space has been occupied, and
that the exhibits are in some cases
cramped for lack of room. The
opening of the new building will
effectually remedy this, and provide
ample accommodations for the collections<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
and their probable augmentation
for some time to come. Its
halls are now being fitted up with
cases. Its appearance is imposing,
and not devoid of a solid and substantial
style of architectural beauty.
Its general character is Romanesque.
The front, which faces Seventy
Seventh Street, is of a rough, light
reddish stone, with a lofty and rather
heavy looking roof of red tiles. It
is approached by two wide flights of
stone steps, connected with a spacious
arched portico by a bridge that
passes over a basement entrance below—a
very convenient and symmetrical
arrangement. Like the
older building, the newly finished
structure has unusually ample window
light, and is altogether well
adapted to the purpose for which it
is designed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BROOKLYNS_STATUE_OF_BEECHER">BROOKLYN’S STATUE OF BEECHER.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By R. H. Titherington.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Let the sound of those he wrought for,</div>

<p class="dcap">Tennyson’s lines on the Duke
of Wellington may well be applied
to the monument that Brooklyn
has set up to commemorate her
greatest citizen and the foremost of
all American preachers. The recently
unveiled statue of Beecher could
hardly be better placed than at the
junction of two main arteries
of traffic, and facing
the City Hall. It stands
at the heart of Brooklyn,
as in another sense Beecher
stood, during his life, at
the heart of Brooklyn and
of the nation. Its location
is in keeping with the
character of the statue,
and with those sides of
the great man’s nature
which it especially typifies.
It should, perhaps,
have been set so as to face
away from the City Hall,
rather than toward it. It
is certainly somewhat unfortunate
that that which
meets the eye of most of
those who see it should
be the back of the statue,
draped in the folds of a
heavy cloak.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp48" id="illus25" style="max-width: 28.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus25.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE STATUE IN FRONT OF THE BROOKLYN CITY HALL.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The monument itself, as
may be inferred from the
mention of John Quincy
Adams Ward as its designer,
is one that shows intelligent
and conscientious
work besides much technical
skill. It is animated
by a definite conception
of its subject, and partakes
of the character of
an ideal group as well as
that of an actual likeness.
The subsidiary portion is
of course wholly ideal; while the
central figure itself is something
more than a reproduction of the
form and features of its original.
Those who remember Mr. Beecher
only in the last few years of his life
may be inclined to think that the
lines of the statue’s face are too deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
and emphatic, that its expression has
too much positiveness and strength,
and too little gentleness and benignity.
There is truth in this criticism, if
criticism it can be called. The
sculptor prepared for his task by
taking a death mask of Mr. Beecher’s
face; but from the more rounded
outlines of the preacher’s later years
he deliberately went back to show
him as he was in the prime of life,
in those stirring times when he led
the vanguard of freedom’s forces.
The statue is Beecher as he will live
in the grateful memory of posterity,
rather than as he lives in the affectionate
recollection of surviving
friends. It is the Beecher of history.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus26.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>HENRY WARD BEECHER.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Indeed, the designer has struck the
very keynote of Beecher’s immortality.
He has given us the man
who voiced the cause of emancipation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
in the days when it was the protest
of the minority against a great
wrong firmly intrenched in the possession
of power; the man who faced
anti-abolition mobs in New York and
the prejudice of a nation in England;
the man who all through his
life seemed to delight in facing unjust
opposition and in fighting the
battle of the weak against the
strong.</p>

<p>He was born during the war
of 1812, a perilous crisis in our
national history. To quote from the
memoir compiled by members of his
family, “he carried war in him as a
birthmark, but with him it was war
against wickedness and wrong.” He
was an abolitionist in his undergraduate
days at Amherst, where his
first attacks upon human slavery
were made in the college debating
society. Then, as a young minister
in an Ohio River town, he was
brought into close contact with the
institution, and saw its actual horrors.
He returned east to Brooklyn to lift up
in that city a voice that presently made
itself heard from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. He would accept no compromise,
and fought with all his
powers against that offered in 1850
by Henry Clay. “For every free
State,” he cried, “it demands one
State for slavery. One dark orb
must be swung into its orbit, to
groan and travail in pain, for every
new orb of liberty over which the
morning stars shall sing for joy.”</p>

<p>He knew full well the strength of
the forces arrayed against him. “An
Abolitionist,” he said later in life,
“was enough to put the mark of
Cain upon any young man that arose
in my early day, and until I was forty
years of age it was punishable to
preach on the subject of liberty. It was
enough to expel a man from church
communion if he insisted on praying
in prayer meeting for the liberation
of the slaves. If a man came to be
known as an anti-slavery man it
almost preluded bankruptcy in business.”</p>

<p>Several times angry crowds
gathered near Plymouth Church and
threatened to attack it, but Beecher
cared nothing for personal danger.
When the irrepressible conflict between
liberty and slavery was reddening
the plains of bleeding Kansas,
he took up a collection in the church
to buy rifles for the free soilers.
Some of them were sent through the
enemy’s lines in Missouri in boxes
marked “bibles,” and though this
was done without his knowledge,
“Beecher’s bibles” became a proverbial
synonym for improved firearms.</p>

<p>When the flame first kindled in
Kansas spread to blaze forth into the
war of the Rebellion, none realized
more fully than he the stern duties
of the hour. Beecher was away from
Brooklyn when the news came that
Fort Sumter had been attacked. On
reaching home he was greeted by his
eldest son with the question,
“Father, may I enlist?” “If you
don’t I’ll disown you,” he replied.</p>

<p>He threw himself heart and soul
into the work of arming for the defense
of the Union. Plymouth Church
became a rendezvous for regiments
passing to the front, and its pastor’s
house at 124 Columbia Heights a
veritable storehouse for military
goods. He was largely instrumental
in raising and equipping three regiments
for the Union army. The
third of these, which he organized almost
unaided, was the Long Island
Volunteer regiment, afterward enrolled
as the Sixty Seventh New
York. In this his son, Henry Barton
Beecher, held a lieutenant’s commission.</p>

<p>Indeed, Beecher’s enthusiasm outran
the government’s unreadiness.
Lack of necessary funds compelled
the army authorities to delay the
acceptance of his volunteers; and in
the summer of 1862, after McClellan
had made his fruitless attempt to
reach Richmond, Beecher gave voice
to his impatience at what seemed to
him the inactivity of the authorities
at Washington. He hated half measures,
and believed that the nearest
way to peace lay through a vigorous
prosecution of the war.</p>

<p>In June, 1863, he sought to find, in
a brief visit to England, rest and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
recuperation for bodily and mental
powers exhausted by the strain they
had endured. Those were the darkest
days of the war. Two years of
campaigning, and vast expenditures
of blood and treasure, had done little
or nothing to break down the rebellion.
Vicksburg was defying the
desperate efforts of Grant, while in
the East Lee, at the head of his
veteran army, was pressing forward
to invade Pennsylvania and outflank
Washington. All the world looked
upon the United States as on the eve
of splitting asunder. In England
the sympathy of the laboring men
was with the North, but the upper
social and official classes were solidly
on the other side. Even such a
man as Gladstone declared that
“Jefferson Davis had created a nation,”
and only a few tribunes of the
people like John Bright and Richard
Cobden publicly pleaded the cause
of freedom.</p>

<p>With his love of battling against
unjust opposition, it is not strange
that Beecher was drawn into a
crusade against the prejudices that
he found prevalent in England—a
crusade undertaken without premeditation,
but one whose results
proved it to be one of his most
notable services to his country. It
was begun in the Free Trade Hall at
Manchester, where he faced a great
and hostile assemblage, secured a
hearing by sheer pluck and persistence,
and then, by his magnificent
oratorical power and the conscious
justice of his cause, won a victory
that was afterward repeated in the
other chief cities of England and
Scotland. His speeches turned the
balance of British sentiment, and
warned the government from the
path that might have led to intervention
in the struggle.</p>

<p>“I believe I did some good,”
Beecher himself said, in speaking of
his missionary work in England. A
New York journal of that time put
it more strongly. “The administration
at Washington,” it remarked,
“has sent abroad more than one
man to represent the cause of the
North and press it upon the minds
of foreign courts and citizens; but
here is a person who goes abroad
without official prestige, on a mere
private mission to recruit his health,
and yet we doubt whether his
speeches in England have not done
more for us by their frank and manly
exposition of our principles, our
purposes, and our hopes, than all the
other agencies employed.”</p>

<p>The value of Beecher’s work in
England was fully recognized by
President Lincoln and Secretary
Stanton. With these leaders, whom
he had never hesitated to criticise
when he believed it his duty to do
so, he now entered into warm relations.
It was he who was invited to
deliver the address at the raising of
the old flag over the regained Fort
Sumter.</p>

<p>His active participation in public
affairs continued up to his death.
His part in the election of 1884 is of
course fresh in the memory of readers—so
fresh, indeed, that it can
hardly be reviewed without intrenching
upon the prejudices of present
day partisanship.</p>

<p>Henry Ward Beecher was a great
man—one of the greatest and most
remarkable men of his day. His
personality was so large, his gifts so
varied, his mental and moral composition
so multiform, that a volume
would be needed to give a complete
character sketch of the man. We
can only attempt within the limits
of this article to bring out the two
main elements of his character that
seem to have inspired Mr. Ward’s
conception of his subject. On the
one hand is the positive, almost militant
expression that typifies Beecher’s
fearless championship of the
oppressed; on the other his universal
sympathy, his unselfish kindliness,
and his especial love for children,
betokened by the figures beside the
pedestal. His heart was as great as
his brain. He was intensely human.
Artificiality he hated, and dissembling
and deception he could not
understand. He was sometimes
called a great actor, but sincerity
was his very breath of life. “Some
men,” he once said, “are like live<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
springs that bubble and flow perpetually,
while others are like pumps—one
must work the handle for all
the water he gets.” And rare indeed
are such live springs of imagination
and eloquence, of intellect and of
affection, as that which welled in
Beecher’s own heart. “He was quite
as likely,” says one of his biographers,
“to burst out into splendid eloquence
amid a small group of chatting
friends, or even to a single
listener, as before a vast audience.
One would as soon suspect the Atlantic
of holding back a particularly
grand roll of surf at Long Branch
until people should come down to
see it, as to imagine Mr. Beecher
keeping a fine thought or a striking
figure till he had an audience.”</p>

<p>Or again, as Oliver Wendell
Holmes says in his essay on Beecher’s
English speeches: “He has the
simple frankness of a man who feels
himself to be perfectly sound in
bodily, mental, and moral structure;
and his self revelation is a thousand
times nobler than the assumed impersonality
which is a common trick
with cunning speakers who never
forget their own interests. Thus it
is that wherever Mr. Beecher goes,
everybody feels, after he has
addressed them once or twice, that
they know him well, almost as if
they had always known him; and
there is not a man in the land who
has such a multitude who look upon
him as their brother.”</p>

<p>When Beecher was a man, he was a
man; when he was a boy, he was a
boy. Brought up in the rigid atmosphere
of an old time New England
parsonage, there was nothing
sanctimonious or unhealthy about
his boyhood religion. Plain living
and high thinking was the regime of
his youth, but withal he was a warm
blooded, high spirited lad. At
school Hank Beecher, as his playmates
called him, was a leader in
outdoor sports, and at college he
was an enthusiastic athlete. Dr.
Holmes called him, later in life, “the
same lusty, warm hearted, strong
fibered, bright souled, clear eyed
creature, as he was when the college
boys at Amherst acknowledged him
as the chiefest among their football
kickers.” Strangely characteristic
was a document that he drew up on
leaving the school at Amherst that
bore the high sounding title of
Mount Pleasant Collegiate Institute.
It was a covenant between him and
his chief schoolboy “chum,” wherein
Henry W. Beecher and Constantine
F. Newell formally undertook, “in
the presence of God and his holy
angels,” to be “real, lawful, and
everlasting brothers”—an agreement
that was faithfully kept, in
spite of long separations, until the
death of Beecher’s boyhood friend in
1842. Another touch of nature that
may be cited from the annals of his
early career was his trial sermon at
Lawrenceburg. No less than a
hundred souls—an unprecedented
assemblage—had gathered to hear
the young college graduate, who is
said to have been so nervous that his
address was a total failure—rather a
contrast to the flow of noble
thoughts clad in impressive language
that afterward held many a vast audience
spell bound.</p>

<p>His forty years’ ministry at Plymouth
Church will always remain a
unique landmark in the annals of the
American pulpit. It was in June,
1847, that Beecher, then in the prime
of early manhood, received an invitation
to become the first pastor of the
newly formed Congregational church,
which had indeed been organized
only the day before, with a membership
of twenty one. Coming to his
charge four months later, the first
thing he did was characteristic. He
had the pulpit cut away, and a simple
desk set in its place, upon a broad
platform. He wanted to draw nearer
to his audience—literally as well as
figuratively. He wished to “get at”
his hearers—to grasp them closely.
He was a fisher of men’s hearts and
souls. Of the wonderful powers that
made his preaching so remarkable in
its effectiveness and so world wide in
its fame it is hard to give a precise
analysis. Among the component
elements were a vividly creative
imagination, a mind richly stocked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
by reading and observation, a ripe
judgment, a deep sympathy, a remarkable
adaptability to occasions
and situations, and an unfailing
earnestness and enthusiasm. He
was an accomplished elocutionist,
with the natural advantages of a commanding
presence and a voice of
great power and flexibility.</p>

<p>From its small original nucleus,
Plymouth Church expanded to be
larger than any other similar body
in the country, with a membership
of fifteen hundred. Scores came to
it from widely variant sects, and
found in its broad and liberal Christianity
a common ground whereon
they could stand together and work
shoulder to shoulder. It has often
been said that nowadays churches
are filled with women, almost to the
exclusion of their husbands, brothers
and fathers. Such was not the case
with Beecher’s congregation. Men
always flocked to hear him, and felt
themselves irresistibly drawn toward
the sunlight of his strong nature.</p>

<p>Intense as was his interest in the
growth and success of Plymouth
Church, it was to him a means, and
not an end in itself. He sought to
make not a prominent church, but
one active and powerful in all good
works. The success of its schools
and missions, its meetings and societies,
was the outward evidence of
the inspiration it received from the
master mind around which it was
focused.</p>

<p>Lesser men have ventured to
criticise Beecher as deficient in
theology. Such criticism implies
inability to understand the great
preacher’s breadth. He was thoroughly
grounded in theological lore
by his father, who was one of the
leading controversialists of the day.
In Lyman Beecher’s home dogma
and doctrine reigned supreme. “Of
him I learned,” his son says, “all
the theology that was current at that
time. In the quarrels between Andover
and East Windsor and New
Haven and Princeton—I was at home
in all these distinctions. I got the
doctrines just like a row of pins on
a paper of pins. I knew them as a
soldier knows his weapons. I could
get them in battle array.” After
graduating at Amherst, he studied
at the Lane Theological Seminary,
of which his father had become president.
He entered into Dr. Beecher’s
controversy against Unitarianism in
Boston, and the subsequent conflict
between the so called old and new
schools of Presbyterianism, of which
latter his father was the protagonist.</p>

<p>But the more he saw of these doctrinal
battles, the less he believed
in their real utility and importance.
“I will never be a sectary,” was a
resolve that he formed very early in
his independent ministry. “Others,”
he once said, “may blow the bellows,
and turn the doctrines in the
fire, and lay them on the anvil of
controversy, and beat them with all
sorts of hammers into all sorts of
shapes; but I shall busy myself with
<i>using</i> the sword of the Lord, not in
<i>forging</i> it.” His religious sympathy
was as wide as humanity, and his
ardor for the good of mankind partook
of the divine, for to quote his
own words again—and the thought
they express is a fine one—the love
of God for man comes “not from a
‘law’ or ‘plan of salvation,’ but
from the fullness of His great heart.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CORNELIUS_VANDERBILT">CORNELIUS VANDERBILT.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By William S. Bridgman.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dcap">Seventy five years ago the
earthly property of the house
of Vanderbilt consisted of a sandy
farm on Staten Island, and a sail
boat that plied up and down New
York Harbor. These modest possessions
have since grown until
they now form the immense estate
which, held together as a sort of
family trust by the sons of the late
William H. Vanderbilt, runs far into
the hundreds of millions of dollars.
The entire previous history of the
world cannot show a parallel to this
financial romance of nineteenth
century America. The gathered
treasures of the Lydian Croesus and
the Roman Crassus would sink into
insignificance beside the bond laden
safes of the Vanderbilts, and Midas,
whose magic touch turned stones
into gold, was, in comparison with
these latter day rivals, a mere plodding
novice in the art of multiplying
riches.</p>

<p>It is not enough to cite, as the
cause of this marvelous accumulation
of wealth, the wonderful abilities
and remarkable good luck of its
founder, the “Commodore.” Difficult
as it is to make a great fortune,
it has often been proved that it is
a still rarer achievement to increase
one inherited from its maker. And
so vast have been the additions to
the estate left by the first millionaire
Vanderbilt, that his bequests, great
as they were, have become overshadowed
by the acquisitions of his
son and grandsons. The late William
H. Vanderbilt made twice as
many millions in seven years as did
the Commodore in the whole course
of his long career of business and
speculation. The former’s sons are
adding to the family “pile” at a rate
which though less sensational is still
rapid, and of necessity gathers momentum
as the “pile” and its power
of earning interest become greater.
Miserliness is one of the last faults
of which they could be accused, but
there is no doubt that their expenditures,
ample as they are, amount to
but a comparatively small share of
the revenue that rolls in from their
colossal investments.</p>

<p>“To what extent is public discussion
of the private affairs of individuals
legitimate?” has become a
question of contemporary interest
and importance. The ultra inquisitiveness
of the daily press has produced
a feeling of revulsion against
the excesses in this direction of
which the “personal journalism” of
the day must plead guilty. Attempts
have even been made to restrain the
progress of modern intrusiveness by
means of the law, as being an invasion
of the constitutional privileges
of the citizen. Whether such a right
can be established by writ or injunction
is doubtful. But if a man cannot
invoke the courts to keep the details
of his private life from the wagging
tongues of a tattling public, yet
a gentleman, among gentlemen,
will find his right to individual privacy
universally recognized. It is
not our purpose to pry into the personal
affairs of a family that enjoys
the respect of all its fellow citizens,
with the possible exception of a few
wild eyed socialists to whom the word
“millionaire” is as a red rag to an
ill tempered bull. But as the mention
of political leaders is inseparable
from an intelligent discussion of national
affairs, so also is it legitimate
and proper to discuss the growth of
a vast fortune that has become apart
of the history of modern finance, and
to canvass the tremendous possibilities
involved in its possession.
The possessors themselves would
readily admit that in the control of
these possibilities they are, in a certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
sense, trustees for the people
at large—though not in the sense insisted
upon by the visionaries who,
in their hostility to individual ownership,
would destroy the foundations
upon which society rests.</p>

<p>There is but one parallel to the
marvelous inheritance of financial
ability that has distinguished the
Vanderbilt family. That one is to
be found in the house of Rothschild,
whose colossal fortune has had much
longer to grow, and has been fostered
by the support of most of the
crowned heads of Europe. In spite
of these facts, the united wealth of
all the branches of the Rothschild
family is estimated at not more than
half as much again as that of the
four Vanderbilt brothers. The
landed possessions of the Astors,
preserved intact for four generations
and augmented by the unearned increment
of New York’s development,
hardly afford a parallel case.
The rising generation of the Gould
family has yet to prove its ability to
manage a fortune which was probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
as great as Commodore Vanderbilt’s
at the time of the latter’s
death, but has since been far surpassed
by the acquisitions of the
Commodore’s successors.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>CORNELIUS VANDERBILT’S RESIDENCE AT FIFTY SEVENTH STREET AND FIFTH AVENUE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Seventy five years ago, as has
already been stated, Mr. Cornelius
Vanderbilt’s grandfather and namesake
was captain of a Staten Island
sail boat. In 1817 he took the bold
step of putting upon his route one
of the new fangled vessels that
went by steam. It paid him well,
and the enterprising young man—he
was then twenty three—branched out
rapidly. He appeared on Wall
Street with a scheme which took
shape as the Nicaragua Transit
Company. The capital of the concern
was placed at the ambitious
figure of $4,000,000, to which the
future railroad king apparently contributed
little except his persuasive
eloquence and his wonderful administrative
ability. This latter
talent was employed so effectually
that the young financier, who acted
as president of the company, soon
grew to an importance that dwarfed
all his colleagues into utter insignificance.
The enterprise was finally
wound up with little profit to the
stockholders; but the Commodore
stepped from its ruins to more extensive
ventures in the same line. During
the rush to California his steamers
divided with those of the Pacific
Mail Company the traffic of the
Isthmus route to the far Western
gold fields. Others crossed the Atlantic,
and at one time he had more
than sixty vessels in commission.</p>

<p>But he was one of the first to foresee
the coming subordination of
steamboats to railroads, and to realize
the immense possibilities of the
latter system of transportation, which
was then hardly out of its infancy.
Gradually abandoning his marine interests,
he sought a firm footing upon
land by buying up the stock of the
Harlem Railroad. Getting a controlling
interest, he used his power
to inflict merciless punishment upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the Wall Street speculators who ventured
to interfere with his plans, and
to meddle with the securities of his
road. From the comparatively insignificant
Harlem, he went on to the
New York Central, the nucleus of the
far reaching highways of steel that
are now known as “the Vanderbilt
system of railroads.”</p>

<p>When the Commodore died, in
January, 1887, in his eighty third
year, he left two sons. The younger,
Cornelius Jeremiah, was the nearest
approach to a black sheep among his
numerous posterity. This statement
must not be interpreted too severely,
for together with utter lack of financial
ability, “young Corneel”
possessed many amiable traits of
character, and retained to the last
the friendship of some of the foremost
of his contemporaries, notably
Horace Greeley. His father, who
regarded his peccadilloes with unrelenting
severity, bequeathed him
only the interest upon the sum of
$200,000. After other legacies
amounting in all to about $15,000,000,
the remainder of the Commodore’s
accumulations were left to his other
son, William H. Vanderbilt.</p>

<p>The man who thus, at the age of
fifty six, inherited a fortune estimated
at seventy five millions of dollars,
was perhaps the most remarkable
member of a remarkable family. He
was born during his father’s early
days of comparative poverty, on
Staten Island, and brought up there
under a household regime of rigid
strictness. For years after the Commodore
became a power in the financial
world, William H. lived the
prosaic life of a plain Richmond
County farmer, and the multiplication
of the father’s millions
brought no luxury or ostentation to
the homestead of the son. The
Commodore had undoubtedly determined
his choice of an heir and
successor long before he gave his
son any encouragement to count
upon the prospect of great wealth.
He tested the young man’s capacity
for railroad management by having
him appointed receiver of a little
bankrupt line on Staten Island. The
experiment was so successful that
William was promoted to be Vice
President of the Harlem road, a
position in which he proved himself
invaluable to his father and to the
property. Thereafter he kept pace
with every forward step of the Commodore
and was a very important
factor in building up the prosperity
of his undertakings. As Vice President
of the consolidated New York
Central and Hudson River he performed
an amount of work which, as
some of his friends think, contributed
to his death—a comparatively
premature one in a family distinguished
for longevity.</p>

<p>In many minds millions breed
envy, and it is only natural that
while William H. Vanderbilt’s wonderful
ability has been universally
recognized, his personal qualities
should have been misrepresented.
Four hasty and injudicious words of
his seem to have made a deeper impression
upon the public mind than
his many notable acts of generosity
and public spirit. The circumstances
under which that famous epigram,
“the public be d——d!” was uttered,
are thus narrated by Henry
Clews, in his interesting volume of
reminiscences, which has also been
the authority for other facts cited in
this article:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The subject [of Mr. Vanderbilt’s interview
with a Chicago newspaper reporter]
was the fast mail train to Chicago. Mr.
Vanderbilt was thinking of taking this
train off because it did not pay.</p>

<p>“Why are you going to stop this fast
mail train?” asked the reporter.</p>

<p>“Because it doesn’t pay,” replied Mr.
Vanderbilt; “I can’t run a train as far as this
permanently at a loss.”</p>

<p>“But the public find it very convenient
and useful. You ought to accommodate
them,” rejoined the reporter.</p>

<p>“The public!” said Mr. Vanderbilt.
“How do you know, or how can I know,
that they want it? If they want it, why
don’t they patronize it and make it pay?
That’s the only test I have as to whether a
thing is wanted or not. Does it pay? If
it doesn’t pay I suppose it isn’t wanted.”</p>

<p>“Are you working,” persisted the reporter,
“for the public or for your stockholders?”</p>

<p>“The public be damned!” exclaimed
Mr. Vanderbilt. “I am working for my
stockholders. If the public want the train
why don’t they support it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>The expression, when placed in its real
connection in the interview, does not imply
any slur upon the public. It simply intimates
that he was urging a thing on the
public which it did not want and practically
refused. The “cuss” word might have
been left out, but the crushing reply to the
reporter would not have been so emphatic,
and that obtrusive representative of public
opinion might have gone away unsquelched.</p>

</div>

<p>William H. Vanderbilt never
sought notoriety for his acts of
munificence, but they were neither
few nor small. He voluntarily paid
to his brother Cornelius an annuity
five times as large as that named by
his father’s will. He presented each
of his sisters with half a million in
United States bonds. He added
$300,000 to the million given by the
Commodore to the Vanderbilt University
at Nashville, Tennessee. He
bore the expense of bringing the
obelisk that now stands in Central
Park from Alexandria to New York—which
cost over $100,000. He
gave $500,000 to the College of
Physicians and Surgeons. His will
distributed another million among
various charities.</p>

<p>That will, which disposed of the
greatest fortune ever yet bequeathed,
was a remarkable document in more
ways than one. It followed the
Commodore’s policy of maintaining
the bulk of the family wealth practically
intact and united, and at the
same time it satisfied the participants
in the distribution, and was commended
as politic and equitable by
public opinion. Ten million dollars
and one of the Vanderbilt houses on
Fifth Avenue were given to each of
the testator’s eight children. Then,
after a long list of smaller legacies to
relatives, friends, employees, and
charitable and religious institutions,
the residuary estate was equally
divided between the two elder sons.</p>

<p>William H. Vanderbilt’s family
consisted of four sons—Cornelius,
William Kissam, Frederick W., and
George—and four daughters—Mrs.
Elliott F. Shepard, Mrs. William
Sloane, Mrs. H. McK. Twombly, and
Mrs. W. S. Webb. All of them were—no
doubt fortunately for themselves—born
and brought up while
their father was a comparatively
poor man, and in their childhood
they knew little of the luxury of
wealth. Never was there a better
ordered household than the severely
simple one where these eight children
received a training that has
been of inestimable value to them.
Rarely has so large a family turned
out so notably well. The four sons
are, mentally and physically, excellent
specimens of the American
gentleman.</p>

<p>There is a saying that it takes
three generations of wealth to make
a gentleman. There is about as
much truth in this as in some other
accepted sayings. It is doubtful
whether three generations of wealth
do not unmake as many gentlemen as
they make. Millionaires’ sons and
grandsons do not usually compare
favorably, either in brain power or
culture, with their fathers and grandfathers.
We have all heard of the
rich man who declined to let his son
travel abroad, not because he objected
to letting his boy see the world,
but because he was unwilling to allow
the world to see his boy. In the
admirable manhood of Cornelius
Vanderbilt and his brothers we see
not the exemplification of a rule so
much as an agreeable exception to
the customary order of social evolution.</p>

<p>Cornelius Vanderbilt was forty
years old when the sudden death of
his father, on the 8th of December,
1885, raised him to the head of New
York’s greatest moneyed family.
That headship is not merely an
empty phrase, it may be remarked,
for the wealth of the Vanderbilts,
though not held in common as that
of the Rothschilds is said to be, is yet
kept together by strong bonds of
family alliance, and is practically
controlled as a unit by the elder
brothers. Entering the world of
business in his teens, as a clerk in
the Shoe and Leather Bank, Cornelius
was always, like his father,
a hard worker. He left the bank to
fulfill the duties of a subordinate
position in the office of the New York
Central, and worked his way up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
ladder until, at his father’s death, he
was ready to take the vacant place at
the head of the management of his
great railroad interests. To the
duties that this position entails his
attention has been unremitting. Not
only does he deal with large
questions of general policy, but he
gives personal attention to details
that many would consider trifling—for
the reason that no one else can
attend to them equally well.</p>

<p>There are few more public spirited
men than Cornelius Vanderbilt. His
charities, as well as his wife’s, are
numerous and unostentatious. He
takes an especially deep interest in
all movements for the benefit of boys
and young men. Of the New York
Young Men’s Christian Association
he is an active supporter, and its
branches for railroad men are largely
his own creation. He gives to these
worthy institutions something more
valuable than money contributions—he
gives them a share of his time and
his personal effort, and is a frequent
attendant and speaker at their meetings.
He also gave to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art one of its finest
and most valuable paintings—Rosa
Bonheur’s famous “Horse Fair.”</p>

<p>Mr. Vanderbilt is a churchwarden
of St. Bartholomew’s, the handsome
Episcopal house of worship on
Madison Avenue. He succeeded to
the office at the death of his father,
who had held it for many years, and
whose name is now graven on a
bronze memorial tablet on the wall
of the edifice. He is active in the
work of the church, and a liberal and
cheerful giver to the missions connected
with it.</p>

<p>In his home life, too, Mr. Vanderbilt
is most happily situated. He is
a model husband and father, and is
very fortunate in his family relations.
He was married eighteen years ago
to Miss Alice Gwinn of Cincinnati,
and has four children. The eldest,
who is named William H., after his
grandfather, is a Yale student, and a
very promising boy.</p>

<p>His New York residence, at the
northwest corner of Fifth Avenue
and Fifty Seventh Street, was built
for him by his father, and is considered
one of the handsomest houses
in the country. Its well chosen pictures
and extensive library show the
cultured mind of its owner, whose
tastes are as refined and intellectual
as his habits are severely simple and
unostentatious. Still, he is far from
being an ascetic, and enjoys the good
things of life, as he has a right to enjoy
them. His cottage at Newport,
The Breakers, is one of the finest of
the summer capital’s palaces. His
holiday trips abroad are spent amid
the social gayeties of Paris and London
or the art treasures of the historical
cities of Italy.</p>

<p>None of the Vanderbilt brothers
is actively interested in the speculations
of Wall Street. Great as is
the power they might yield in the
battle of bulls and bears, they prefer,
wisely indeed, to stand aloof
from the fray and to devote themselves
to the management of their
vast and substantial property. It is
fortunate for the public that their
great moneyed possessions are in
hands where they have been proved
to be a benefit and not a menace to
the body politic.</p>

<p class="center"><i>By Elliott E. Shaw.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dcap">I think I must have been dreaming
these last few hours. It is
all so strange. I wonder if it is
always so terrible to do what is
right! I don’t believe she ever suffered
before in her life. The look
that came from those dark eyes of
hers when I pushed her away and began
to speak will haunt me to my
dying day. She almost fainted.
Well, it is all over—and there is left
for me—nothing but the remembrance
of her love and the one thing
that I shall ever have to my credit on
the books of heaven.</p>

<p>Waiter, some brandy—was that
brandy that I just swallowed?—it
was? How long have I been at this
table? What? Twenty four hours?
Ah! I remember now that you are
not the first waiter who brought me
brandy, nor yet the second, and I
think you tried to get me to go home
and get some sleep. It was kind of
you—but I have no home—and I
cannot sleep. I can never do anything
more in this world but remember—remember.</p>

<p>By heaven, it was hard to do! But
she will see some day that I was
right, and perhaps years from now
when she is a woman—a mother,
perhaps, with a red cheeked boy in
her arms repeating his innocent
prayers—she may think of me and
forgive me. And I may be dead,
then. And if I am not dead, I’ll—I’ll
be a broken, haggard old man with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
a chain on my leg and a brand on
my shoulder just as I have one now
on my soul.</p>

<p>How she cried! I felt like a brute.
Ah, I know that feeling well, but it
is strange that I should have despised
myself so for the first decent thing
I have done since I was a laughing
boy! How I love her—I who have
laughed so at love. Thirty eight
years of cynical disbelief against one
year of absolute love. Thirty eight
years, eleven months, and thirty days
of disreputable life against one day
of self sacrifice. That is my record.
And what a sacrifice it was! To
give up the woman one loves and
make her despise you, that she may
not suffer.</p>

<p>How happy we could have been,
but for——it was happiness to me
just to sit beside her and watch her
at some little womanly act, to see
her smile, to know that her soul was
as white as the feathers of a swan,
and to say to myself, “This woman
actually loves me—me, a”—pshaw,
I don’t like to say the word even to
myself. How sweet she was! She
used to put her little hand on my
head and stroke my hair and ask me
what it was that worried me so much
(for with her woman’s intuition she
soon learned that there was something
that troubled me) and I would
laugh and tell her that it was the
fear that some day she might cease
to love me. Then she would kiss me
and tell me that I need never fear
such a thing as that. Then she
would call me foolish and laugh and
kiss me again. I can feel her faint
breath on my brow now.</p>

<p>I am sure I could have made her
happy, even though I am what I am.
If I could have married her I would
have guarded her as carefully as the
Creator guards the angels. She
would never have learned even the
alphabet of the black side of human
life. We would have been rich and
respected and happy—oh, so happy!
But that man—that man with the
gold rimmed spectacles whom I see
everywhere, frightens me. I can feel
the atmosphere of Scotland Yard
about him, although he looks almost
benign. If I could ever catch him
looking at me, I should be satisfied
that he is not what I fear. But although
he seems to be everywhere I
go, he apparently pays no attention
to me—and therefore I know that he
<i>has been looking at me</i>, and has turned
away as suddenly as I have turned to
look at him. It was the only thing I
had to warn me. It may be after all
that he has no interest in the capture
of an escaped—but I could not run the
risk, for her sake. After all, I am
well disguised. I have changed a
good deal in a year. It is nearly a
month since I first noticed him, and
he has evidently been unable to make
up his mind yet. I suppose, too, that
it is a little hard for him to believe
that I could ever have been introduced
into the society of the most
respectable people in all New England,
and be engaged to the daughter
of a millionaire. Ha! Ha!
These English detectives are slow—but,
confound it! They—are—most—disagreeably—sure.
Well—I
don’t care about it now. It is
almost over.</p>

<p>It has been a strange story. To
come here a hunted criminal—a convicted
one, too—with my ill gotten
money in my pocket and my identity
a secret—to have been introduced to
good society through a chance acquaintance—to
have been introduced
by that same acquaintance to a
woman I could actually love—what
is more wonderful still, to win that
woman’s love—to be on the point of
marrying her and then to fear arrest—to
fear far more than that—to fear
breaking her heart! It has been a
strange story, all of it. I did something,
though, that very few men
could have done—very few, indeed,
of those who have never known a
temptation and never done a wrong.
I gave her up, that she might not be
unhappy—that she might not be disgraced
as she would have been some
day—for after all, I am certain that
my time has almost come. I can
wear the hideous clothes of a convict—I
can bear disgrace, for I am used
to it—I can stand the hard, unceasing,
degrading labor, and the disgusting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
food—but I cannot disgrace
her—I cannot!</p>

<p>And I did it all yesterday. I went
to her. She greeted me with a loving
smile, the memory of which will
solace me in the long years of suffering.
She was entertaining, with the
aid of her sister, some intimate
friends. They were all delighted to
see me. Ah, how happy people must
be who are respectable! She came
to me with outstretched arms as I
entered the room, and I pushed her
roughly away. Oh, it was agonizing—she
burst into tears and threw herself
into the arms of her sister. I
could not tell her that I was a forger,
a professional criminal, but I told
her that I was an adventurer—that
I did not love her, and that I had intended
to marry her merely for her
money. I told her, too, that I had
learned that her father was on the
point of bankruptcy (it was a lie, of
course, all of it) and that I wished
to be released from my engagement.
I said it before them all. I acted
splendidly. It broke her heart, it
disgusted the rest, it almost killed
me—but, thank heaven, it saved her
future. Then I mockingly took my
leave.</p>

<p>And since then I have not slept,
nor eaten, nor felt the effect of the
brandy I have poured down my
throat—and what is more, I have not
cared whether that man with the
gold rimmed spectacles was watching
me or not. I have done what
was right—I have actually done
what was right once in my life, thank
God!</p>

<p>Ah—there—is—that—man—again!
And—he is coming toward me.
There are—other men with him. He
is looking at me now—deliberately.
He knows me. It is all up. Come
on, Avenger, come on. I welcome
you with both my outstretched hands.
Where are the irons?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_EPISODE_OF_NUGGET_BAR">AN EPISODE OF NUGGET BAR.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By H. L. Wilson.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dcap">The mining camp of Nugget Bar,
with its twenty or thirty tents
and cabins, did not present a particularly
inviting scene to the anxious
gaze of Julius Anderly, as he urged
his tired beast, with its conglomerate
burden of camping utensils and mining
implements, over the last half
mile of his journey. The mountains
seemed to cower down as low as possible
before the blaze of the setting
sun, and their rugged sides and bald
tops were marked with shadows and
sun pictures, quaint, curious, and
fantastic.</p>

<p>The scene was wildly picturesque,
after its own primitive style, and
Julius Anderly was rather disconcerted
by the novelty of its rough grandeur;
but he was more disconcerted
by the group of some half dozen men
he discerned lounging in front of
what he rightly supposed was the
only hotel in the camp.</p>

<p>As he drew nearer he was quite
positive that the big burly man with
the bushy beard would prove anything
but an agreeable companion; he was
probably one of those men he had
been told about who always carried
a loaded pistol in a convenient pocket,
and who regarded a refusal to drink
whisky with him as an insult sufficiently
deadly to justify said pistol’s
immediate and destructive discharge
upon and against the person of the
audacious abstainer.</p>

<p>And the portly gentleman, who
wore a battered “plug” hat, and was
seated upon an empty claret case,
had a marked magisterial bearing,
more autocratic than reassuring.</p>

<p>The landlord, tall, thin and lazy,
who occupied the doorway, was the
least ferocious in appearance. The
other members of the group seemed
to Julius to be only passively dangerous—safe
as long as they were
let alone.</p>

<p>The big burly man who formed
one of the group in front of the
“Golden Nugget,” and whom <i>we</i>
know to be Hank Purdy (designated
by certain envious and despicable residents
of Nugget Bar as “Windy
Purdy”), paused in the narration of
the details of a sanguinary combat
between himself and six stalwart
Apaches, alleged to have occurred in
some remote section of the West at
some remote period, and interjected
the word, “Tenderfut!”</p>

<p>As the term fell from his lips at
the instant his eyes fell upon Julius,
who had now approached quite near,
we cannot do otherwise than consider
the term as applied to the latter.</p>

<p>Yes, Julius was undeniably a tenderfoot
steeped in all the infamy that
the term implies. The newness of
his outfit, his awkward manner of
strapping the same to the animal’s
back, and his own genial and unsuspecting
countenance, all united to insult
every acclimated Californian,
and particularly the group before
which he now paused.</p>

<p>Julius was short, rather fat, and benevolent
looking; with a big head,
slightly bald, and a smooth, round
face and blue eyes, expressive of
utter and perfect confidence in all
mankind.</p>

<p>He stood irresolute a moment, and
then, with an appealing look upon
his face, said, tentatively, “How do
you do, gentlemen? I presume this
is Nugget Bar.”</p>

<p>Now according to all preconceived
notions of Julius, the tall, thin landlord,
who was apparently very lazy,
and whose name, by the way, was
Sam Turner, should have been bluff
and hearty looking, and should have
at once replied in the bluff, hearty
manner of landlords (in the books
Julius had read), “Right ye air,
stranger, and who mout ye be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>But the owner in fee simple of
Nugget Bar’s sole hostelry was
shamefully ignorant of the social requirements
of a man in his position;
indeed he was distinctly permeated
by an air of social irresponsibility,
and he only said, in a very deliberate
way, without evincing the slightest
curiosity regarding a possible patron:</p>

<p>“Ya-a-s, I presume ’tis; leastwise
what’s left uv it.”</p>

<p>Again spoke Julius, with the unuttered
appeal for comradeship still
his predominant facial expression:</p>

<p>“Well, I’m Julius Anderly. ‘Jule’
mother always calls me at home, and
that’s way back in Ohio, you know.”</p>

<p>The company remained unmoved
by this piece of family intelligence,
with the exception of a little dark
man, lacking, physically, an eyebrow,
and mentally, a happy disposition,
who volunteered the remark
that he “wunst had a cousin die in
Ohio.” Julius ventured to lean
against one of the supports of the
wooden awning and continued:</p>

<p>“Things have been going pretty
bad with our folks back there for
some time. Pa died—let me see, this
is July—three years ago last March,
and after that the support of ma and
the girls fell to me, which was about
all pa had to leave, except the home. I
guess we’d pulled through all right
enough if the firm I had been keeping
books for for over ten years hadn’t
up and failed—went clean under and
hadn’t a cent left.”</p>

<p>The various members of the group
here expressed to each other, ocularly,
their contempt for any man who
“kept books,” all except the little dark
man, whose face plainly expressed an
inward conviction to the effect that
the failure of that firm was due solely
to Julius’s defective method of keeping
said books.</p>

<p>It was rather discouraging, but
Julius continued: “And there I was
out of a job, which was pretty bad, I
call it. Times were hard all round
there and I couldn’t seem to get in
anywhere else.</p>

<p>“We heard a good deal of talk
about Californy, how so many were
striking it rich here—I b’lieve that’s
what you call it when a man finds a
lot of gold—and we thought, that is
ma and the girls and I did, that perhaps
I’d better come out here, even
if it was a long ways off, and see if I
could find a gold mine or buy an interest
in one or something. We sat
up nights and talked it over and read
a whole lot about how to come and
what to do, and finally ma mortgaged
the house for twelve hundred dollars,
and I started out here with a thousand—round
by the isthmus, you
know.”</p>

<p>Another ocular expression of contempt
from all parties for a man who
would make the trip from the States
in a boat instead of pushing straight
across the continent as they had done;
the little dark man showing by the
same means his belief that there was
some secret and cogent reason for
that route being chosen.</p>

<p>“Well, I got to San Francisco, and
the first person I got acquainted with
there was a very kind gentleman
named Walker Smith, who had
known of my folks back in Ohio. He
knew all about mines and owned a
great many himself. I told him what
I was after, that I’d come out to
make a little money, and as a friend
of his up at Sacramento had a valuable
mine that Mr. Smith thought he
could buy, I gave him five hundred
dollars to go and buy it for me.”</p>

<p>Julius was visibly affected at this
point, and in a most gentle manner,
intended to be brutal in the extreme,
called to his burro that had strayed
a few yards away and was leisurely
cropping the scanty vegetation, to
“come up there.”</p>

<p>Thus having given vent to his pent
up emotion (though the animal was
utterly deaf to the command), Julius
went on:</p>

<p>“Well, that was over six months
ago, and I’ve never seen anything of
Mr. Smith since that day I gave him
my money—all in gold, too.”</p>

<p>This time the expressions of contempt
were not confined to looks,
but broke forth audibly from all sides.
Only the little dark man remained
silent, and he nodded his head in a
very knowing manner, thereby suggesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
that he attributed to Julius a
voluminous catalogue of atrocities,
which he could specify if it became
necessary; and furthermore that he
caviled at the others for their deplorable
lack of insight into character.</p>

<p>Apprehending that he had placed
Mr. Walker Smith in a bad light before
these gentlemen, Julius made
haste to defend him.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there were some men in
San Francisco that I’m sure were
enemies of Mr. Smith, and <i>they</i> tried
to make me believe he was dishonest
and was lying about the mine; but I
didn’t mind them, because he had told
me just where the mine was and
everything about it; why, he even
showed me a piece of gold that had
been taken from it. At last I made
up my mind that he had been murdered
and robbed of my money, so
I’ve come up this way to find some
gold for myself. But you can’t tell
me,” he added, after a second’s reflection,
“that Smith was dishonest.
He knew of ’most all our folks.”</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of the matter
of Mr. Smith’s probity, Julius began
unstrapping his outfit, and by
his general demeanor gave the
others to understand that he had at
last found a home and friends.</p>

<p>This time the limited vocabulary
of the group would not admit of any
adequate expression of their contempt,
so they were obliged to resort
to looks again, the little dark man intimating,
by a peculiar expression of
mingled horror and distrust, that this
was positively the most insinuating
villain he had ever met.</p>

<p>“An so yu think this yur’s ’bout
the place whur yu kin make yer pile,
do yu?” queried Hank Purdy, as he
emptied the ashes from his pipe by
rapping it against the palm of his
left hand.</p>

<p>“Well, they told me down below
that there was gold up here and that
I was to be careful and not be taken
in. And perhaps you gentlemen will
tell me where to dig—kind of advise
me, you know.</p>

<p>“I’m very anxious to find some
gold in a little while—I don’t care for
so very much, only a few thousand
dollars—and I don’t want to dig very
deep for it, ’cause I’m not used to
hard work. And besides I’ve got to
get it quick, for I must start back
home before fall, or ma and the girls
will think I’m sick or something.</p>

<p>“Just tell me some place where I
can get it quick; some place close
around here, if you know any.”</p>

<p>Mr. Purdy was the first of the
party to recover his mental equilibrium
after the preferment of this extraordinary
request, and lost no time
in stating emphatically that he would
be something which could only be
expressed here by a long dash, in the
event of Mr. Anderly not being about
the freshest thing he had ever seen.</p>

<p>“An’ so yu hain’t got no more’n
a couple a days to spare, an’ yu’d
like to make a snug little pile and git
out a here by ’bout day arfter tomorrow,
would yu?” again queried Mr.
Purdy.</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t that a little soon?”
asked Julius.</p>

<p>“Not a bit uv it. People air
comin’ in an’ goin’ out a here every
day er so. All they hav’ to do is to
jes scratch eroun’ a little mite, ’n
they’re sure to turn up a whole pile a
nuggets.”</p>

<p>“No? You don’t mean to tell me
so!” exclaimed the now radiant and
delighted Julius.</p>

<p>“Fact; you betchu!” asseverated
Mr. Purdy. “Leave ’t the jedge
there if ’taint.”</p>

<p>The “jedge,” he of the damaged
head gear, claret nose and judicial
bearing, confirmed Mr. Purdy’s statement
with regard to the abundant
natural resources of Nugget Bar, in
a manner admitting no doubt of his
sincerity, so that Julius did not require
the concurrent statements of
the other members of the party,
which were nevertheless given.</p>

<p>Julius now felt his troubles to be
at an end. A few days more and he
would be a comparatively rich man.
He expressed his astonishment that
fortunes were picked up so easily.</p>

<p>“Ya-a-h, minin’ ain’t what ’t chused
to be,” went on Mr. Purdy.
“Why, when I was first out, ther
was four uv us a prospectin’ up on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
the divide one time, ’n she set in to
snow fer all git out, ’n we got lost ’n
wandered eround ther fer ’leven
days, all uv us on foot, ’n not a
blamed horse in the crowd. The
on’y thing we had to eat was snow
and stewed saddle, yessir, fact. We
cut up that (dashed) saddle ’n biled
’er ’n used to chew on’t fer hours ’t a
time, ’n she saved all our (dashed)
lives too. Nowadays these yur
people kim in yur ’n git it jest fer
pickin’ it up.”</p>

<p>This tradition of Mr. Purdy’s had
come to be looked upon as apocryphal,
inasmuch as he had never been
able to explain satisfactorily how the
party had obtained the saddle, since
they were all on foot and had no
horse. His reply to any question
touching upon the source of that
appetizing article was always conceived
in a spirit of the profoundest
irritation, and delivered with vehemence,
disgust, scorn and contempt.
But the present recital being solely
for the delectation of Julius Anderly,
this defect was not touched upon.</p>

<p>Julius was duly impressed by the
incident and said as much, and again
expressed a willingness to be directed
to some spot close at hand where
untold gold, easy to access, was waiting
to be put to good use by deserving
mortals.</p>

<p>“Wal,” said Mr. Purdy, “I s’pose
the jedge there knows a more good
places to find gold eround yur than a’most
any ether man. I ekspects he’s
prob’ly the best man fer yu.”</p>

<p>The judge, who was usually
drunk, and commonly thought to be
incompetent on that account, had got
himself elected as Justice of the
Peace by keeping the coming election
and his candidacy a secret from all
save his most intimate friends, and
so long as he had nothing to do he
was permitted to do it.</p>

<p>With the worried air of a man who
controlled the affairs of the universe,
and withal, a look of pretended
sagacity, the judge opined that there
was a “splen’d place to dig out there,”
with a sweep of his right hand comprehending
most of the western
hemisphere.</p>

<p>Mr. Purdy, at this striking proof of
the soundness of his judgment, assumed
a triumphant expression and
said, “Ther! wha’d I tell yu?”</p>

<p>Julius gazed blankly out over the
bar and up the gulch, and down over
the trail he had traveled, and then
with the utmost delicacy, and with
all due deference to the dignity of
the bench, suggested that perhaps
the direction given by the judge was
not sufficiently definite to be of any
practical utility; but he was none the
less hopeful for all that.</p>

<p>Mr. Purdy was on the point of requesting
the judge to confine himself
to some given spot, when the face of
Mr. Turner lighted up with the fire
of inspiration. He said: “Now look
a here, Anderly, they’s a spot right
out back a this here shanty where I
think you’d find whuchu want. I
been a goin’ to dig there myself fer a
long time now, but I’ll jest turn ’er
over to you, an’ by gun, you can have
whuchu find there.”</p>

<p>Mr. Turner did not state that the
spot he referred to was where he had
projected a cellar in which to store
surplus provisions; that, if there had
existed any means of getting said
cellar there otherwise than by hard
work, he would have had it there long
ago; and that there was about as
much likelihood of finding elephants’
teeth there as gold. But, nevertheless,
this all passed through his mind.</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir,” said Julius,
“you are not laboring under the
delusion that I want to take any
man’s mine and use it to my own
advantage, I hope. I couldn’t think
of taking what another man had
found. I just thought some of you
could kind of advise me.”</p>

<p>The absurdity of supposing that
Mr. Turner would labor under any
circumstances, not even excepting a
delusion, was so apparent to the
judge that he was moved to smile
knowingly; but at an indignant look
from Hank Purdy he straightened
himself up and stared hard at the
mountains, as if he were possessed of
some recondite knowledge concerning
their origin and manner of construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“Wal, I admit it’s mighty gen’rous
in me,” said Mr. Turner, with a
sublime look of self abnegation upon
his honest face, “but I tell you we’r’
none uv us mean around these here
diggin’s, not if we know it; and ’sides
thet, I got a dozen or so places jest
as good as thet ’t I kin go to any
time, so I guess you jest better go to
work there t’morrow an’ git whuchu
kin out uv it.”</p>

<p>Julius was profuse in his earnest
expressions of gratitude, but Mr.
Turner waved him off and magnanimously
said it was nothing—which
was quite true.</p>

<p>Then Julius had his supper and
was shown to the back room, where
he was to pass the night.</p>

<p>Upon Mr. Turner’s explaining his
object in inducing Julius to dig back
of the hotel, whereby he was to be a
new cellar the gainer, he was unsparingly
praised for bringing about his
object by this poetical idealization of
a cold, hard reality, in the mind of
Julius, and then the gentlemen drank
something, the little dark man, as he
ordered his without any water, wishing
every one to remember, when
Julius Anderly’s true character
became known, that he had warned
them against him from the first.</p>

<p>As they drank to the completion of
the new cellar, Julius was heard in
his room, musically entreating some
person, evidently a female, to lay her
brown head upon his breast, which
vocal effort was not favorably received,
especially by the little dark man,
who muttered, as he ambled off
toward his tent, that they “didn’t
want no layin’ of heads on breasts
around there.”</p>

<p>The next morning found Julius
digging laboriously in the hard
ground back of the hotel, within the
space marked off by Mr. Turner, with
a song upon his lips and the firm
conviction in his breast that in a few
days he would be on his way to Ohio
with the money that was to make ma
and the girls comfortable.</p>

<p>All day long he worked assiduously,
never pausing to note the looks
of contempt and ridicule that were
cast upon him by the passing miners
who were working up the gulch with
pick, shovel and pan.</p>

<p>That night Mr. Turner’s cellar was
half done, and Julius was as hopeful
as ever, confidently remarking to
Mr. Purdy that he would surely find
the gold tomorrow, as he was getting
the space narrowed down now.
He jubilantly dilated upon the
manner in which he would apply his
fortune, not forgetting to mention
that the whole party were to have a
big supper at his expense—which
caused the judge to regret, momentarily,
that the whole thing was a
practical joke upon the Easterner.</p>

<p>Julius rose betimes the following
morning, and again proceeded to
work, as confident that the sun would
set upon him a rich man that night
as he was that a temperance movement
was the one thing needful in
Nugget Bar.</p>

<p>That afternoon about four o’clock,
as the usual group were gathered in
front of the “Golden Nugget,” indolently
discussing various abstract
moral and social problems, of which
this story does not take cognizance,
and Mr. Turner was inwardly congratulating
himself on the imminent
completion of his cellar, Julius Anderly
suddenly appeared around the
corner of the house, his pick and
shovel on his shoulder. He had the
air of a man who had finished his
day’s work.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I’ll have to leave
you in the morning,” he said.
“There’s a party of miners from up
the gulch going down, and I can go
with them; I found the gold all right
enough, thanks to you, Mr. Turner,
and my other friends here.”</p>

<p>“You wha-a-t?” screamed Mr.
Turner, evidencing more energy than
had ever before characterized any
remark of his made within the hearing
of any of the assembled residents
of Nugget Bar. “You found
<i>wha-a-t</i>?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve found the gold, you
know,” answered Julius, slightly bewildered
by the general paralytic
attitude of the group, and by this
unexpected and unprecedented display
of energy on Mr. Turner’s part.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
“I’ve got a whole pile of gold round
here—found it just as you said—and
a man that saw me says I may go
down with his party tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Consternation was written upon
the faces of all the group. Consternation?
Yes, and wild alarm,
terrified surprise, and incredulity
and anger and sheepishness, and
many other emotions too numerous
and heterogeneous to admit of
specification. With one accord they
dashed off to the scene of Julius’s
labors.</p>

<p>Yes, there was a pile of golden
nuggets, just as they had been taken
from their strange, unthought of
hiding place, where some fanciful
freak of nature had stowed them—a
most convincing proof of nature’s
whimsicality.</p>

<p>There was no doubt but what a
rich pocket had been struck, and yet
the good citizens of Nugget Bar,
and especially those who had lately
served Julius in an advisory capacity,
seemed prone to discredit the evidence
of their sight and touch, and
handled the precious fragments as if
they were something intangible.</p>

<p>And in the midst of all the flurry
and excitement stood Julius, radiant
and joyful, his cherubic face wreathed
in a quiet smile of contentment,
and not one bit excited or surprised,
because had not these rough but
honest men told him he would find a
lot of gold there, and he had found
it as a matter of course?</p>

<p>Resuscitative measures were now
in order, and were inaugurated at
Julius’s expense. Nugget Bar ate
and drank late and deeply that night,
but as Julius left next morning with
the party “down below,” most of
it was up with its aching head and
bitter tasting mouth to see him off,
and the little dark man was heard to
remark that he had told them so from
the first, and now he supposed they
were satisfied—which they were not.</p>

<p>The landscape in the rear of the
“Golden Nugget” was soon terribly
disfigured by Nugget Bar picks and
shovels, and Sam Turner’s cellar was
enlarged to proportions that no self
respecting cellar would be guilty of
assuming; but I never heard that
Nugget Bar found another pocket
there.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">I.—Columbia College.</span></h3>

<p class="dcap">While the highest prestige of
age and renown attaches to
those of our American universities
that are located in lesser towns, the
tendency of recent times seems to
be rather toward the development of
fully equipped educational institutions
in the great urban centers of
population. Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton, it will generally be admitted,
still stand foremost, but New
York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore
have built up universities whose
subordination needs to be qualified
in some particulars—for the scientific
department of Johns Hopkins and
the medical branch of the University
of Pennsylvania rank at least as
high as those of the older colleges,
while Columbia’s rapidly increasing
wealth has enabled it to advance
with greater rapidity than any of its
sisters. Established in prerevolutionary
times, generously fostered
by the State, by the Trinity Church
corporation, and by private munificence,
the development of New York
has so augmented its revenue that it
has now become a university in the
fullest sense of the term, and possesses
among its schools three that
are unequaled in the United States.</p>

<p>From the time it was chartered, in
1754, until 1857, its extensive college
grounds were situated on what is
now one of the most crowded commercial
districts of the city—that
between College Place and the North
River. It was chartered under the
name of King’s College, and was
supported and controlled by Church
of England influences. For this
reason it was disfavored by other
religious denominations, and a hard
struggle existence ensued until
the corporation of Trinity Church
came to the rescue, by granting it
the tract of land already mentioned
and enabling the college to erect its
first buildings.</p>

<p>Misfortune was again encountered
at the breaking out of the Revolution.
The college was regarded as a
nest of Toryism, and the committee
of public safety essayed to suppress
it by ordering the buildings to be
prepared for occupation by the
troops. Under this misuse the college
had been reduced to a state
almost requiring recreation, when in
1784 the Legislature reincorporated
it under its later name. In 1857 the
site was removed to the present location
at Madison Avenue and Forty
Ninth Street.</p>

<p>The five departments of Columbia
College are those of Arts, of Mines,
of Law, of Political Science, and
of Medicine, and in addition there is
an annex for women, known as
Barnard College, in honor of the
lately retired president, Frederick
A. P. Barnard. The schools of Law,
Mines and Medicine are the leading
ones of the country.</p>

<p>The School of Arts provides the
usual classical education, at a
cost to students of $150 for the annual
fee. There are a number of
free and prize scholarships, and seven
three year fellowships of $500 per
annum. There is also a post
graduate course of wide scope.</p>

<p>Seven parallel courses of engineering
are pursued in the School of
Mines, the fee for which is $200
for each of the four years of study;
and there is besides a post graduate
course of two years for the degree
of Bachelor of Philosophy. The
work done in this department is of
the most exact and thorough character.
A feature of it is the regular
excursions of parties of students
under the supervision of their instructors
into the foundries and work
shops of the city, or to the scene of
some large field construction for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
purpose of “carrying the chain” and
of surveying.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp56" id="illus32" style="max-width: 32.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus32.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>COLUMBIA COLLEGE—THE LAW SCHOOL BUILDING.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The School of Law, since its organization
in 1858, has sent forth
the major portion of the great legal
lights of the country. The course
occupies three years, at an annual
fee of $200, which, in common
with the fees of the other departments,
may be remitted at the discretion
of the Faculty.</p>

<p>Political science furnishes another
department extending over three
years. At the end of the first year
the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy
is conferred; that of Master of
Arts at the end of the second year,
and at completion the student receives
the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy.</p>

<p>Barnard College, organized a few
years ago, is kindred in scope to the
School of Arts, and requires an
equally severe entrance examination
for qualification to matriculate.
Already in its short history it begins
to evince a high standard of scholarship,
and bids fair to take a leading
position in the ranks of college annexes
for women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>All the foregoing, except the last
named, are located on the ground
between Forty Ninth and Fiftieth
Streets and Madison and Fourth
Avenues. The remaining branch, the
College of Physicians and Surgeons,
has lately, through the royal munificence
of private individuals, been
enabled to secure a splendid extension
of its facilities. The late William
H. Vanderbilt in 1885 presented to
the college the sum of $500,000, with
which an ample site was purchased
at Fifty Ninth Street and Ninth Avenue
and suitable buildings erected.
This princely gift was followed by
another from the donor’s daughter,
Mrs. W. D. Sloane, who, with her husband,
built, and equipped, at a cost of
$250,000, the Sloane Maternity Hospital,
controlled by the college. Yet
again, the four sons of Mr. Vanderbilt
established a free clinic, known
as the Vanderbilt clinic, which also
called for an expenditure of a quarter
of a million dollars. Though since
its foundation in 1807 the P. &amp; S., as
it is popularly called, has been the
leading school of medicine of the
western world, these superb examples
of philanthropic liberality have
placed it in a position to compare
with the foremost schools of Europe.</p>

<p>The income of Columbia is mainly
derived from the rentals of extensive
grants of real estate received from
Trinity Church and the State.
These holdings are situated both in
the crowded districts of trade and
the neighborhood of wealthy residence,
and their values have largely
increased with time.</p>

<p>As guardian in chief of this vast
estate and director of the progress
of a modern university, the president
of Columbia needs to be a man of
rare qualifications. High scholarship
he should have as the head of a
learned institution, and rare business
ability he must have as the manager
of the various interests intrusted to
his care. The college is fortunate
indeed to have at its helm one who
so eminently combines the qualifications
of the scholar, the gentleman,
and the practical man of affairs as
does Dr. Seth Low.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of colleges,
Columbia provides no living quarters
for its undergraduates, who, separating
each day to their widely distributed
homes or lodgings, enjoy
nothing of that unique existence
known as “college life,” so dear to
the recollection of the alumnus.
This does not, however, banish an
intense college spirit, fostered by
Greek letter fraternities, literary societies,
many subdivisions of athletic
organization and scores of little
cliques or clubs, like so many
branching roots of a noble loyalty.</p>

<p>The college, on its removal to its
present site, consisted of a now venerable
and imposing building, in
style approaching the Colonial, and
occupying the center of a full city
square, admitting of extensive
grounds and an ample campus. On
this space there have from time to
time been erected various additional
buildings for the accommodation of
the fast growing schools, until now
the original structure is almost completely
surrounded with these modern
edifices, a compact mass of impressive
appearance and great capacity.
The buildings of the medical
school combine the results of modern
ingenuity in the attainment of the
most perfect convenience with pleasing
architectural effects.</p>

<h3>II.—<span class="smcap">The University of the City of New York.</span></h3>

<p>A noteworthy Gothic structure of
white freestone, situated on the once
aristocratic Washington Square, is
the principal seat of the University
of the City of New York. To the
many pleasing associations of the
past that cluster around this locality,
the University building contributes
the lion’s share. Besides lending its
academic dignity to the spot, its
studios and apartments were long
the abiding place of the leaders of
the artistic and literary coteries of
the city. It is memorable, too, as
the scene of the world famed achievements
of two of the University’s
professors—Professors Samuel F. B.
Morse and John W. Draper, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
former of whom here invented the
recording telegraph, and the latter
first applied photography to the representation
of the human countenance.</p>

<p>The origin of the university was
philanthropic. In 1829 seven prominent
New Yorkers—bankers, merchants,
and professional men—met to
consider the establishing of a liberal
university, designed to comprise a
graduate division for the pursuit of
advanced studies, and an undergraduate
division devoted to classical
and scientific courses. Calls for
subscriptions met a liberal response,
and the college was speedily launched.
The building, which was erected
in 1835, is now occupied by the
Department of Arts and Sciences,
the Schools of Law and Pedagogy,
besides the chairs of several post
graduate courses in line with the
intentions of the founders.</p>

<p>A medical department of high
rank dates from 1841; it is situated
in an ample building in East
Twenty Sixth Street, opposite Bellevue
Hospital, where practical instruction
is obtained by the students.
Among its noteworthy
features is the Loomis laboratory,
occupying a five story wing, which
was erected at a cost of $100,000.
This money was received from
an unknown donor, through Dr.
Alfred L. Loomis, one of its best
known professors; and among the
conditions of the gift was the strange
proviso that the name of the giver
should be kept secret.</p>

<p>Some of the branches of the
university are liberally endowed;
others are supported by the
fees of the students. Among the
latter is one whose recent establishment
is indicative of the breadth of
plan contemplated by the governors.
This is the School of Pedagogy, ably
presided over by Dr. Jerome Allen.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the University
is Dr. John Hall, who succeeded Dr.
Howard Crosby in the office. The
institution does efficient work in all
its branches, and has been eminently
successful in the achievement of the
founders’ design—“to diffuse knowledge.”</p>

<h3>III.—<span class="smcap">The College of the City of New York.</span></h3>

<p>The third of the great general
educational institutions of the metropolis
is entirely distinct from the
one last described, in spite of the
confusion between them that exists
in the minds of many New Yorkers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
who should be better informed. The
similarity of name is certainly misleading,
and for that reason a little
unfortunate.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp91" id="illus34" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus34.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, AT TWENTY THIRD STREET AND LEXINGTON AVENUE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The College of the City of New
York is a public institution in the
fullest sense of the term. It is a
supplement to the municipal system
of common schools, and with those
schools is under the control of the
Board of Education. It was established
in 1848 by the authority of the
Legislature; its first class matriculated
in the following January and
graduated in 1853. It was not, however,
until 1854 that the Legislature
bestowed upon the Free Academy, as
it was then called, full collegiate
powers and privileges as regards
conferring upon graduates the usual
degrees in the arts and sciences. In
1866 it was admitted to the circle of
the State’s colleges that are scrutinized
by State Regents. At the same
time was adopted the modern and
more dignified name that it has since
borne.</p>

<p>The curriculum at this institute is
divided into three courses, the classical,
the scientific and the mechanical,
each occupying four years, and preceded
by a preparatory course of one
year. The classical course gives
especial attention to Latin and
Greek, but includes one modern
language. The scientific course
comprises mathematics and the
modern languages as the leading
subjects of study. The mechanical
course differs from the scientific in
that it gives more prominence to the
applications of mechanical science,
and calls for practice in the workshop
and the chemical laboratory
during the whole course. There is
also a post graduate course in
civil engineering, extending over two
years.</p>

<p>The College of the City of New
York has always been a target for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
the assaults of politicians, and many
attempts have been made to secure
its abolition on various pretexts.
Through all of them, however, the
institution has triumphantly marched,
and under the presidency of
General Alexander S. Webb it has
gained increased scope and efficiency
with every year. It has long been
remarked that the names of its
graduates are more than ordinarily
prominent among the leaders of post
graduate departments elsewhere.</p>

<p>The College is situated at Lexington
Avenue and Twenty Third Street.
The buildings are constructed of
brick, and are valued at $225,000.
They contain a library of 26,180
volumes, a natural history cabinet
of 7,500 specimens, and scientific apparatus
to the value of $28,000.</p>

<p>On the accession of General Webb
in 1869 the College had on its rolls
27 instructors and 447 students, at a
cost to the city of $125,000 a year.
At the present time there are 44 instructors
and 1,450 students, while
the increase of the annual expense
has been but $23,000. The faculty
has comprised some famous names:
Horace Webster was the institution’s
first president and professor of
philosophy, and Gerardus B. Docharty
its professor of mathematics.
Charles Edward Anthon was professor
of history and belles lettres
from 1852 until his decease in 1883.
Other notable names on the roll are
those of Oliver W. Gibbs, General
William B. Franklin, John C. Draper,
Russell Sturgis, and R. Ogden
Doremus.</p>

<p>New York’s system of public education
has received severe, and unfortunately
not unjust criticism,
which has been called forth by defects
in the common schools, and
especially by their inadequate seating
capacity. The advanced department
of the system, however, is
recognized as a model of efficiency.
Its very completeness and success
have often been used to emphasize
by contrast the imperfections of the
common schools, to whose pupils it
offers gratuitously the benefits of a
collegiate course and collegiate degrees.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Healthful outdoor
sports and exercises
have in the last few
years grown to a remarkable
vogue and
popularity in this
country. Their cultivation has indeed
been one of the most notable
social developments of the past quarter
of a century. England has led
the world in the various branches of
athletics, and the general participation
in them by her people has done
much to make the English race distinguished
among nations for the
best standard of physical development.</p>

<p>But already we are fairly dividing
the honors with her. In yachting
we have built the boats and reared
the sailors that have outsailed, time
and again, the best yachts England
has ever produced. American riflemen
and American oarsmen have
held their own against the best talent
of England. Even in cricket,
their great national game, picked
teams of Englishmen have been met
and vanquished by transatlantic invaders.
Of running, walking and bicycling
records America holds her
share, and of those for short distances
she has the great majority. In
high jumping, throwing the hammer
and putting the weight, American
athletes are in the lead. Tennis and
polo are newer games here than in
England, but our standards in them
are of the highest. Baseball is peculiarly
our own, and it has been developed
to a wonderful degree of
scientific skill reached by no other
outdoor sport.</p>

<p>“The pleasure of exercise,” says
Dr. Holmes, “is due first to a purely
physical impression, and secondly to
a sense of power in action. The first
source of pleasure varies, of course,
with our condition, and the state of
the surrounding circumstances; the
second with the amount and kind of
power, and the extent and kind of action.
In all forms of active exercise
there are three powers simultaneously
in action—the will, the muscles
and the intellect. Each of these
predominates in different kinds of
exercise.” The Autocrat discusses
the relative merits of walking, riding
and rowing, concluding with the
statement that rowing “is the nearest
approach to flying that man has
ever made or perhaps ever will make.
As the hawk sails without flapping
his pinions, so you drift with the tide,
when you will, in the most luxurious
form of locomotion indulged to an
embodied spirit. You can row easily
and gently all day, and you can row
yourself blind and black in the face
in ten minutes, just as you like. It
is in the boat, then, that man finds
the largest extension of his volitional
and muscular existence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>In a later edition of the “Autocrat
of the Breakfast Table,” from which
the foregoing quotation is made, Dr.
Holmes adds in a foot note: “Since
the days when this was written, the
bicycle has appeared as the rival of
the wherry. The boat flies like a
sea bird with its long, narrow, outstretched
pinions; the bicycle rider,
like feathered Mercury with his
wings on his feet.”</p>

</figure>

<p>These are eloquent tributes to
boating and to cycling, and well deserved
they are; but after all, for refined
sport in its highest development
one must turn to that most exhilarating
of all pleasures—horseback
riding. That this view is held
by those whose income is sufficient
to warrant the indulgence of their
tastes is evidenced by the enormous
growth in horsemanship in America
within the last few years. It is hardly
too much to say that it is now regarded
as quite as important in a
social sense for young men and
young women to be proficient in riding
as in dancing. Rowing, yachting,
swimming, and tennis, it is true,
share its popularity in the midsummer
months, but riding is an all the
year round sport—a sport that in the
cool months of spring and fall, and
the colder months of winter, has no
rival among all the forms of outdoor
exercise. And, indeed, I know of no
other pleasure on a brisk, cool day
that gives the physical invigoration,
the keen enjoyment, and the ruddy
glow to be obtained from a gallop in
the park. But to get the fullest
pleasure the rider must be well
mounted and well trained in his art.
He should have his own horse—an
animal with light, springy action
and graceful movement, one that
pleases the eye, too, for pleasure
comes not alone from a sense of
exercise. Furthermore, the rider
and his horse should be on good
terms. The latter, if an animal of
good temper and intelligence, is sure
to do his part well when the proper
overtures are made to him—when
he is treated kindly and wisely, and
is made to understand clearly what
he is expected to do. With such an
understanding between rider and
horse each enters into the sport with
spirit and zest, with a mutual confidence
and mutual desire for an exhilarating
dash that rewards each
alike with—as Dr. Holmes says of
boating—“the most luxurious form
of locomotion indulged to an embodied
spirit.”</p>

<p>This degree of pleasure is not
within the compass of the novice—not
within the grasp of the man of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
bad temper and coarse mental composition,
who hasn’t the confidence
and love of his horse—not within
the bounds of possibility to him
who rides a school horse, which is, as
a rule, little more than a hack—a
horse in appearance, to be sure, but
not a horse in the finer instincts and
finer feelings of the carefully bred
and well cared for animal.</p>

<p>The school horse, which is ridden
by riders of all grades, by men of
varying moods and widely different
tempers, is sometimes
treated kindly, but more
frequently abused, and is
too often pushed to the
point of exhaustion—such
a horse soon loses its
spirit, and forgetting its
better nature settles down
into a plodding, unintelligent
machine.</p>

<p>To become an expert
oarsman one must give
months, even years, to
practice. This holds true
of all sports in which one
wishes to excel, and yet
the average man evidently
thinks, from the assurance
he displays in sallying
forth to ride, that he can
without any training
mount a horse and forthwith
become a perfect
horseman, when the only
equipment he has for the
undertaking consists of
his two legs which enable
him to sit astride the
saddle. But this does
not constitute riding in
its true sense. That is an
accomplishment to be acquired
only by the most
painstaking training and
long practice. When
one sees the men—and
women too, for that
matter—who, having had
no training and possessing
no knowledge of the
horse, yet insist upon attempting
to ride, he is
reminded forcibly of the
old adage that every man
thinks he can run a newspaper or
keep a hotel. So it is with horsemanship.
If the novices who venture into
Central Park on horseback and out
upon the road could see themselves
as the true horseman sees them, they
would perhaps conclude that riding
is an accomplishment in which they
are wofully deficient.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SOCIETY IN THE SADDLE—A RIDING ACADEMY CLASS.</p></figcaption>

<p>But the ridiculous features in the
riding of the novice are of little importance
as compared with the
danger to the rider and a greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
danger to others, for it is the horse
of the novice, for the most part, that
makes riding on the Central Park
bridle path, or any crowded thoroughfare,
so hazardous. Anything
that gains the stamp of social approbation
is sure to be taken up by a
veritable army of would-be fashionables.
This latter set, which in a
city like New York is a numerous
one, moved by an intense eagerness
to “do the correct thing,” immediately
takes it up and makes a “fad”
of it, regardless of such considerations
as fitness or lack of fitness for
the thing attempted. But fortunately
for horsemanship this superficial
class does not constitute the
great body of riders in the metropolis.
Horsemanship has taken too
firm a hold of the intelligent and
wealthy portion of the community,
who as a rule do things well, to be
in danger of such declension. It has
awakened an interest that has
prompted the establishment of not
less than half a dozen large training
schools and several riding clubs, of
which many of the best citizens of
the city are members. The work of
the training schools—and all of them
are kept busy—includes individual
instruction during the day and class
riding in the evening. A few years
ago but one or two riding schools had
been established in New York, and
their recent increase shows how
rapidly horsemanship has gained in
popularity. The riding teachers,
and each school has a number, are
almost without exception drawn from
the best European institutions of the
kind. With such instructors the
schools of New York are turning out
as fine riders as the English or
French academies. The number of
enthusiastic equestrians and equestriennes
who own their own horses
and ride with painstaking care to
perfect themselves in the accomplishment,
is growing larger every year.
Class riding has become one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
most enjoyable evening recreations
of New York during the winter
months. Every night in the week
different classes fill the big riding
academies and ride to the accompaniment
of music. The classes are
led by professors of the school, and
are put through many fancy figures,
which are varied with plain riding,
sometimes the gallop, sometimes the
sitting trot and more frequently the
rising trot. On special nights jumping
and exhibition riding of the
most difficult sort are given. There
are galleries for spectators in all the
schools, and these are usually filled
by friends of those in the ring.
Class riding in the Park is very
popular, and during the spring and
fall excursions into the country in
the cool of the day, returning by
moonlight, after dining at some suburban
hostelry, are frequent and
highly pleasurable to the participants.</p>

<p>Central Park, on a September afternoon,
when the expensive equipages
of the wealth and fashion of the
city are to be seen on the East Drive,
presents much the appearance of
Rotten Row. This similarity has
been greatly enhanced by the increased
number of fine riders—men
and women—who fly gayly along the
bridle path that skirts the favorite
drive.</p>

<p>Riding is almost universally commended
by physicians, and their indorsement
of its health giving qualities
has certainly contributed to the
firm hold it has upon a great and
growing constituency. The passion
for outdoor exercise that has so
thoroughly taken possession of
American men is shared fully by
their young wives and sisters. It is
doubtful if any other form of sport
in the open air appeals to them with
anything approaching the same force.
They have not the physical strength
necessary for rowing and the active
games whose votaries are animated
by the reckless enthusiasm exhibited,
for instance, in the gentle game of
football. But they can ride, and ride
well, and with quite as keen enjoyment
as their brothers. Another
cause, perhaps, of the pastime’s rapid
growth in popularity among women
lies in the fact of the wonderful improvement
in riding habits. The old
time habit, with its tremendous skirt,
was an enormity—a thing to transform
a handsome woman into a being
so ill proportioned and so ungainly
that it is a wonder she ever had the
courage to disfigure herself with such
an outrageous garb. But the habit
of today is a thing of beauty and a
joy forever—when the right girl
wears it. There is, perhaps, no costume
in which a good figure appears
to better advantage than in the latest
style of snug fitting, short skirt
habit.</p>

<p>If the art of more skillful tailors
figures to any extent in luring fair
woman into horsemanship, then
much honor to the tailor, though he
be, as tradition has it, but one ninth
of a man. The fact that more
women ride now than formerly is
good enough reason why more men
are at present enthusiastic riders;
for where the girls are there shall
the men be also.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_ACCIDENTAL_ROMANCE">AN ACCIDENTAL ROMANCE.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By Matthew White, Jr.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dcap">His friends called Radnor Hunt
a cynic. He laughed lightly
when accused of being cold and
unresponsive, and declared that
he must have imbibed the trait
unconsciously from the nature
of his work, for winter landscapes
were his specialty. But
now and then when he was alone, in
the little studio over the stable in
Fifty Fifth Street, where he worked
by day and slept by night, he would
look at himself in the mirror over
his dressing case and—laugh again,
such a hard, bitter laugh, that sometimes
he shuddered on hearing it,
and glanced fearfully around him as
if dreading to see the author of the
sound.</p>

<p>“I, a cynic, a woman hater!” he
would mutter, putting his hand
above his eyebrows and leaning forward
to peer more closely at himself
in the glass. “Bah! how blind the
world is! Who would believe from
<i>this</i> what rages <i>here</i>?”</p>

<p>And with a quick motion he would
sweep his hand across his face and
place it for an instant over his heart.
Then, as if in utter disgust with himself,
he would hastily turn out the
light, fling himself on his bed, just
as he was, and sleep thus till morning.</p>

<p>And yet Radnor Hunt was reckoned
a moderately fortunate young
man. He had come to New York
knowing no one, and now, after a
two years’ residence, he had had a
picture in the Water Color which
brought him orders for three others,
while half a dozen periodicals were
always ready to pay well for his
“pot boilers,” the pen and ink work
which Radnor despised.</p>

<p>He was an only child. His father
had been a country doctor in a Connecticut
town, who, contrary to the
usual rule, had been proud of his
son’s artistic tastes and had encouraged
him in them. This, instead of
being grateful for it, Radnor frequently
recalled with bitter regret.</p>

<p>“If he had only laughed at my
first attempt, taken my paints away
from me and put me to some business,”
he would sigh. “Then perhaps——”</p>

<p>But here he usually broke off his
reflections, while a strange light
would come into his eyes. It was in
this mood that he frequently sprang
up from his work to jam his hat
fiercely over his brows and go out
to take a long walk that was utterly
aimless.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hunt had both died
within a few months of one another
the winter before Radnor left home.
He was twenty three then, and that
summer he had passed with his
cousin, Mrs. Stilton Barnes, in the
Adirondacks. Mrs. Stilton Barnes
was a Philadelphian who lived south
of Market Street and who had at
once conceived a great fondness for
the handsome young relative whom
she met for the first time in thirteen
years at his mother’s funeral.</p>

<p>Radnor well remembered having
worshiped her at a respectful distance
when he was a small boy. She
was then a happy hearted girl just
leaving her teens behind her, and
with her head too full of lovers, one of
whom might turn out to be a husband,
to pay much attention to the little
fellow in knickerbockers whom she
often caught looking at her with
unveiled admiration in his great
blue eyes.</p>

<p>Now positions were reversed.
Camilla Hunt had become Mrs.
Stilton Barnes, the wife of the well
to do jeweler. The plumpness that
had been the beauty of her youth
had transformed itself into a buxomness
that positively shocked Radnor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
when he first beheld it. He wondered
how he could ever have found
this woman charming and—here she
was becoming really enthusiastic
over him.</p>

<p>“My dear cousin,” she exclaimed,
“why did you not let me know what
I was missing? Why, you would
have been a treasure indeed at my
Friday evenings last winter,” and
she would put up her lorgnettes for
another survey which sent the blood
surging to poor Radnor’s cheeks and
made him look handsomer than
ever.</p>

<p>Camilla Barnes was thoroughly
candid and outspoken. Before she
left Cheltenham she told Radnor
that if she had had the slightest idea
that he had developed into such a
presentable specimen of humanity
she would have had him out of that
sleepy old town long before.</p>

<p>“It’s too late in the season to do
anything now,” she added, “but I
must insist on your spending the
month of August with us at Lorimac.
We shall then have plenty of
opportunity to talk over the future.”</p>

<p>Nor would she go away until
Radnor had given his consent. After
all, she was his cousin, and if she
chose to extend to him the hospitality
of a hotel, why should he not
accept it, as he would have done at
her own home?</p>

<p>Radnor’s pride was the most notable
element in his make up. It was
indomitable, unyielding. Even as a
boy it permeated his life, and made
him miserable whenever in his
studies he fell short of the high standard
he had set for himself.</p>

<p>But for the reasons given he finally
decided to accept his cousin Camilla’s
invitation. If he could have
read the future and foreseen the consequences
of that Adirondack visit,
he would have shunned the place as a
plague spot.</p>

<p>At least this was what he told himself
almost always when he recalled
it. At other times he felt that he
would not have had the experience
left out of his life for all the joys
that the entire span of three score
and ten might have in store for him.</p>

<p>Even before this period he had
gained some fame and a little money
as an illustrator of children’s books,
and now that the last tie that bound
him to Cheltenham was severed by
his mother’s death, he decided that
he would take the step which the
nature of his work rendered almost
a necessity—settlement in some city
close to his markets.</p>

<p>However, this could now easily be
deferred till fall, and meantime he
had the estate to close up, and then
the month with Mrs. Barnes
would doubtless do much toward the
shaping of his plans.</p>

<p>Radnor had traveled but little,
still he possessed that quality of
adaptiveness that made him seem
easy and at home wherever he was.
His mother had been a Bournie, of
Huguenot descent, and of the most
delicate refinement. Radnor inherited
this quality from her in very
large degree, tempered with the rugged
persistency and vigor of his
father.</p>

<p>Her cousin’s arrival at the Lorimac
House created all the sensation Mrs.
Stilton Barnes could have wished.
With the tact of a true diplomatist she
had said but little about him beforehand.
Expectations too fully roused,
she well knew, were almost invariably
doomed to disappointment. So
she had merely told a few of her
most particular friends that she expected
a cousin of hers from New
England.</p>

<p>“A young artist,” she added, “who
has recently lost his mother, so
I shall not be expected to give
him a gay time.”</p>

<p>Men, of course, were scarce at this
distance from the cities. There were
any number of boys in their teens,
and several dudes, who spent almost
as much time as the ladies in devising
new combinations of sash and
hat bands, outing jackets and shirts.
This fact had been uppermost in
Camilla Barnes’s mind when she
asked Radnor to come to Lorimac.
She felt that he would tower head
and shoulders above all the other
males at the hotel.</p>

<p>“And who knows but he may make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
a rich catch?” she even whispered to
herself.</p>

<p>It was a reversal of things, she
knew, this exploiting of a man, but
then the very uniqueness of the process
added zest to it for this woman
whose nature craved excitement of
this sort above all other things.</p>

<p>When Radnor’s train came in she
walked across the road to the station
to meet him. She had seen to it that
he took the express, which would
bring him to Lorimac just before the
supper hour, when everybody was on
the piazzas, looking out for the new
arrivals.</p>

<p>“You are very welcome, Radnor,”
she said, when he came up to her
amid the crowd.</p>

<p>She gave him both her hands,
forcing him to drop his valise while
he took them for a moment. Then
they walked across to the hotel together,
and while he registered, Mrs.
Barnes tapped her jeweled fingers
together and glanced half carelessly
around the great office, with its big
fire place in one corner and the many
groups scattered about. And she
saw in that apparently casual glance
all she wanted, and knew that the
first impression Radnor had made
was an extremely favorable one.</p>

<p>That evening, however, she introduced
him to no one. They sat together
in a remote corner of the
piazza, talking over old times, the
future, the walks and drives around
Lorimac.</p>

<p>Radnor said but very little. It was
not necessary. His cousin was fond
of talking, and she certainly found
Radnor a most attentive listener.
The only fault she had to find with
him was that he did not ask questions
enough. There were dozens of pretty
girls in the dining room at supper
time, in a few of whom it might be
supposed he would have some little
interest. But he always allowed
Camilla to speak of them first, except
in one instance, and then he asked
about a young lady whom she did
not know and had not observed.</p>

<p>“She came up on the train with
me,” Radnor explained then, and
Mrs. Barnes made a resolve to find
out the entire facts about the new
comer before she went to sleep that
night.</p>

<p>This was not difficult to do. Pleading
fatigue from his journey, Radnor
went to his room before ten, leaving
his cousin to join a group of ladies
who each evening occupied the same
corner of the drawing room, and
gossiped—gossiped of all that went
on before their eyes, and of much
else that never went on at all, with
indefatigable zeal.</p>

<p>“Oh, didn’t you see her?” exclaimed
Mrs. General Barentham
when Mrs. Barnes mentioned the
matter. “Ah, of course, you were
absorbed in that charming cousin of
yours. I trust you are not going to
make a practice of keeping him entirely
to yourself. But about Miss
Bellman; you must have heard of her
coming. She is that New York girl
who is so immensely wealthy in her
own right, and with it all is so sublimely
beautiful. Did you ever, Mrs.
Penford, see more exquisite coloring?”</p>

<p>“Never,” was Mrs. Penford’s emphatic
acquiescence.</p>

<p>“And such repose of manner,”
went on Mrs. Barentham.</p>

<p>“Are you sure about that heiress
part of it?” inquired Mrs. Barnes
earnestly. “You know how often
these rumors get out without one particle
of foundation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is perfectly trustworthy,
my dear,” rejoined the general’s
wife. “The Bellman estate in New
York is one of the best known of the
vested interests in the metropolis.”</p>

<p>“With whom is she here?” Mrs.
Barnes now wanted to know.</p>

<p>“With her uncle’s family, the
Grants; very distinguished people,
too. The McBrintons know them,
so I suppose we shall all be presented
tomorrow.”</p>

<p>It was very seldom that Camilla
Barnes’s conscience troubled her,
and on this particular night it
was not that which kept her
awake long after she had sought
rest. The single instance of Radnor’s
manifestation of interest in the girls
of the Lorimac, the exalted position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
financially occupied by Olive Bellman,
the coincidence of their having
come up on the same train—these
three facts combined kept
Camilla’s brain in busy ferment for
many hours.</p>

<p>“But I must be cautious,” she kept
reminding herself. “I must make
haste very slowly. I wonder how
long they are going to stay—how
much time they will give me?”</p>

<p>She was introduced to the Grants
the next morning by Miss McBrinton,
while the ladies were all gathered
with their fancy work in a shady
corner of the piazza. Olive was included
in the presentation, but she
seemed scarcely to heed the ceremony.</p>

<p>She had no work in her lap, but
sat there with one hand on the railing
of the piazza, while her eyes
were fixed most of the time on the
hills across the lake.</p>

<p>Radnor had gone by himself for a
row. Mrs. Barnes never ventured on
the water except for a few minutes
in the evening. She had told him
where to look for her when he came
back. Everything had turned out so
far exactly as she had planned. She
hoped he would not stay out too
long. With this one thought she returned
to active participation in the
discussion of Mrs. Dorrington’s
nursemaid, who insisted on calling
herself a governess, and hence declared
that she had a perfect right
to sit at the first table with the
others.</p>

<p>Olive rose presently and walked
towards the front door, where she
remained standing for a while, evidently
drinking in to the full the exquisite
view of the lake from this
point.</p>

<p>“My dear,” called her aunt, “you
are in the sun. Let me send for your
hat.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother, Aunt Elizabeth. I
was just going up stairs, and I’ll get
it myself.”</p>

<p>The girl disappeared, and at that
moment Mrs. Barnes caught sight of
Radnor returning in his boat.</p>

<p>And the same thing happened during
the next two days. It seemed
as if fate had decreed that the two
were not to meet.</p>

<p>But Camilla had ascertained that
the Grants were to remain through
the month, and she endeavored to
possess her soul in patience, feeling
that after all this was the very best
of beginnings.</p>

<p>“How like him she is,” she said to
herself more than once, when noticing
traits in Olive that made her
seem different from the other girls.
“They say that men always find
their ideal in their opposites, but
then it is the exceptions that prove
the rule.”</p>

<p>Of Olive herself she never once
spoke to Radnor, but then so far as
the girl’s position and prospects went
there was no need for her to say a
word. By nightfall of the day succeeding
her arrival the facts were
known throughout the hotel. Radnor
had played two or three games of
billiards with General Barentham,
and the general was almost as great
a gossip as his wife.</p>

<p>It was not until the third evening
that the meeting took place, and then,
oddly enough, it came about without
the agency of Camilla at all, and
while she was working hard to compass
it in an entirely different way—seated
in the writing room with Mr.
McBrinton trying to persuade him
to join her in getting up a launch
party.</p>

<p>Radnor meanwhile was in the parlor,
entertaining a large company of
boys with stories of his bicycling experiences.
It was while thus engaged
that Mrs. McBrinton touched him on
the shoulder and asked him if he
would not make up a hand at whist.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Barnes came in a few
moments later she caught her breath
quickly on beholding her cousin
seated <i>vis-a-vis</i> to Olive Bellman at
the card table.</p>

<p>After that the acquaintance progressed
as rapidly as she could have
desired. Nearly every morning found
the two on the tennis courts, where
they were the most evenly matched
pair of players that the Lorimac had
seen that season. Then in Olive
Radnor found as enthusiastic a lover<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
of the water as himself, and the afternoons
were devoted to exploring
tours around the shores of the lake.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant or Mrs. McBrinton
generally accompanied them on these
expeditions, and it was odd to hear
them sing Radnor’s praises among
themselves.</p>

<p>He was naturally chivalric towards
all, and the little attentions he bestowed
on the chaperones were so
self evidently spontaneous and disinterested
that the hearts of the old
ladies were completely won.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barnes felt as though she
were on wings. It was a real effort
for her to keep her exultation under.
Indeed, even now she never trusted
herself to mention Olive’s name to
her cousin.</p>

<p>Thus affairs went on till the last
week in August, when the grand
Venetian Carnival was held on the
lake. General Barentham took the
greatest possible interest in the celebration
and was determined that the
Lorimac House should outdo all
competitors in the grand procession.
He constructed a Lohengrin
swan boat out of his naphtha launch,
and after begging and entreating for
three days, almost on his knees, succeeded
in obtaining Olive Bellman’s
consent to be the Venus who should
sail in it.</p>

<p>“But you don’t want a Venus,
General Barentham,” she protested.
“Venus belongs to Tannhaeuser.
You want a Lohengrin if you are
going to have a swan boat.”</p>

<p>“I want nothing of the kind,” the
general responded. “I want you, and
I am going to have you,” and in the
end he triumphed.</p>

<p>Radnor was selected to be Olive’s
companion in the launch and do the
steering in the dress of the Swan
Knight, while the engineer, concealed
as deftly as possible by the counterfeited
wings, was tucked away in the
stern. General Barentham was here,
there and everywhere, managing the
rest of his flotilla, and the guests of
the Lorimac not in the “show,” as
Radnor insisted on terming it, were
accommodated on the steam launch
Meteor.</p>

<p>The procession started at four
o’clock to make the tour of the lake,
and the plaudits that greeted the
swan barge everywhere were loud
and prolonged. But the engine of
the launch worked badly, and once
the engineer was forced to run
ashore to see what he could do at
easing matters.</p>

<p>This put them behind, and when
they started on again it was already
beginning to grow dark.</p>

<p>The wind was rising too, and
presently the boat was tossing in
quite a sea. Radnor took off his
coat and insisted on wrapping it
around the “Venus,” and they both
cowered behind the windward wing
of the Swan to escape as much as
possible the pelting rain that now began
to descend.</p>

<p>Not a very romantic situation
truly, but nevertheless Radnor found
in it his perilous turning point.
Olive was so brave, so patient, so
confident in his ability to bring them
safely into port, showed to him, in
short, a side of her character that
had not yet been presented to him,
that—well, he went down before it
as so many men before him have
done before their fates, and when he
helped a wet, bedraggled Venus out
of the boat at the Lorimac pier he
realized that the sooner he got out
of the Adirondack woods the better
for his peace of mind.</p>

<p>It had all come on him like a
lightning stroke, or, as he preferred
to compare it himself, with the swiftness
of the flash in night time
photography. He had gone on so
joyously, so confidently, with no
thought beyond the contentment of
the present.</p>

<p>“But why should I not go on and
be happy?” he asked himself that
night as he tried calmly to review the
situation.</p>

<p>To be sure there were Miss Bellman’s
millions, contrasted with his
own poverty. The world would be
sure to talk, but then he would wait
and work, and perhaps some day he
would feel that the gulf between
them was not too wide to be spanned
by their clasped hands. And with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
this ravishing possibility for his last
waking thought he fell asleep.</p>

<p>He woke early, and with the new
hope strong within him, he felt he
could not endure the confinement of
four walls until his customary rising
time. He dressed and went out to
walk beside the lake, which now
reflected back the overshadowing
hills from a mirror-like surface that
it seemed could not be the same on
which the swan boat had been so
rudely tossed but yesterday. He had
never seen the Lorimac so peaceful;
all was quiet in the early morning;
even the birds seemed to have hushed
their music for the moment. There
was not a sound but the tiniest lap
of the ripples against the stony
shore at his feet and—yes, here was
a jarring discord overhead as his
walk brought him just beneath the
summer house.</p>

<p>Two French nursemaids were sitting
there, talking in their own
language, in which Radnor was well
versed.</p>

<p>“See there!” one of them exclaimed.
“Here he comes now.
Madame Barnes arranged it well,
did she not, that they go off in the
swan boat? Such a fortune is not to
be trapped every day, and as she
couldn’t marry it herself, she wanted
to have it in the family somewhere.
It’s the talk of the house how she’s
been playing off the handsome cousin
for the——”</p>

<p>But by this time Radnor was out
of hearing, his cheeks flaming with
indignation, his teeth set fiercely together,
his fingers tightly pressed
against his palms.</p>

<p>So he had been a puppet in the
hands of the scheming Camilla.
“A very docile and obedient little
puppet,” as he told himself, for he
had gone and done the very thing
expected of him.</p>

<p>As he would have scorned and
loathed another man who would have
deliberately lent himself to such a
scheme, he now scorned and loathed
himself, all innocent as he was.
And his cousin Camilla? He felt
that he could not bring himself even
to see her again.</p>

<p>The common talk of the house, forsooth!
Aye, this was easily believable,
for had he not heard it with
his own ears from the very nursemaids?
The Bournie pride rose
tumultuously in Radnor’s breast.
He wanted to get away from Lorimac,
from men and women, from
himself, from everything that could
remind him of his humiliation.</p>

<p>His walk had now brought him to
the fence which separated the hotel
grounds from the forest adjoining.
Placing his hands on the topmost
rail Radnor vaulted lightly over and
plunged into the underbrush, taking
a certain sort of satisfaction in
trampling down the low bushes that
lay in his path.</p>

<p>For an hour he roamed on, by
some instinct always holding the lake
in view. It seemed that he must keep
in motion or be overwhelmed by the
wild, maddening thoughts that were
surging through his brain.</p>

<p>He could liken himself only to
Tantalus, about to drink of the life
giving draught, to have it dashed
from his very lips. But in his own
case another cup had been substituted—a
cup so bitter and revolting
that, strong man as he was, he shuddered
at the realization of its existence.</p>

<p>When or why he turned around he
knew not, but presently he found
himself approaching the hotel again.
As soon as he caught sight of its outlines
he paused, half determined to
strike off into the deeper woods.
And at that instant he heard his
name called.</p>

<p>It was his cousin Camilla. She
had been out looking for him, and
now came forward, keen anxiety on
her face and in her voice, as she exclaimed:
“My dear Radnor, what has
come over you? I have been really
concerned about you. Here it is
almost ten and you have not been to
breakfast yet. A maid said you had
come into the woods, and you can
imagine how eager I was to find you
when I ventured here myself.”</p>

<p>She held up her gown, to the trimming
of which a many forked twig
had fastened itself, shaking it at him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
suggestively. But he neither answered
her smile with another, nor made
any motion to disengage the dress.
His face took on a hard, stern look
Camilla had never seen on it before,
and if Radnor had not been too fully
preoccupied to notice it he would
have been interested in observing
the fading out of the smile on hers
and the creeping into its place of a
strange expression of commingled
fear and defiance.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, the
silence broken only by the stirring
of the leaves overhead in the gentle
breeze that had just sprung up, and
by the shrill voice of one of the
Carew boys calling out—“Love,
fifteen,” on the tennis grounds. Then
Radnor spoke.</p>

<p>“Why did you do this, Camilla?”
he said. “No,” he went on hurriedly,
as she opened her eyes in real or assumed
mystification. “You need
not waste time in asking what. I
shall tell you all. You wanted me
to marry rich, deliberately planned
to have me do it, as any silly match
making mother with a daughter to
get off her hands would have done,
and now the whole scheme is the talk
of the servants’ hall and the
sculleries. I am sorry to have to
disoblige a lady, but under the circumstances
I must make my adieux
to you at once.”</p>

<p>He lifted his hat and struck off
towards the hotel.</p>

<p>“Radnor, you are mad,” Camilla
called after him, but he never turned
his head; and it was the talk of the
house for the rest of the day that
Radnor Hunt and his cousin had
breakfasted separately.</p>

<p>But the gossips had a yet richer
feast in store. Radnor left on the
noon train, and—how it got out no
one exactly knew—but it was
rumored for a fact that he had insisted
on paying his own bill. Mrs.
Stilton Barnes took her departure
almost immediately afterwards, and
the following week the Grants left
for Au Sable Chasm, Miss Bellman
of course accompanying them.</p>

<p>All this, as has been explained,
happened two years previous to the
opening of the present account of
Radnor Hunt. He had gone straight
from Lorimac to New York, and
plunged into work with desperate
earnestness. And so well had he
succeeded that, starting in the metropolis
without a friend, he had now
not only a comfortable income, but
would have been warmly welcomed
at a dozen homes had he chosen to
accept the invitations he received.</p>

<p>He was even chary of companionship
with his own sex. It seemed as
if his faith in the entire human
species had been shaken, and while
his fellow artists and the literary men
with whom he came in contact, all
liked him, none ever succeeded in
becoming more than an acquaintance.</p>

<p>And thus, lonesome as a hermit,
Radnor lived on, taking his successes
without enthusiasm, for there was
no one else to reap the benefit of
them. He suffered as one without
hope, for no matter now what
fame or riches he might attain, he
felt that after what had happened
he could never make any attempt to
secure the only thing in the world
that was precious to him.</p>

<p>Sometimes during his long solitary
vigils in the studio he would try and
plan how things might have gone if
he had not chanced to understand
French. Already before the Carnival
he had received an invitation to call
if he made up his mind to settle in
New York. He might have been
very intimate at the great house on
Madison Avenue by this time. He
passed it now and then in his walks,
and once he met Olive just as she
was crossing the sidewalk to step
into the carriage.</p>

<p>She smiled as she bowed, and
turned partially as if she expected
he was going to stop, but he walked
on rapidly, and always after that
avoided the avenue whenever possible.</p>

<p>The first summer after his settlement
in New York he spent in
Europe, traveling and sketching;
the second he went to Labrador with
a scientific expedition. From this he
had now returned, as the early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
October frosts were sending the
reddened leaves skurrying to earth,
and the out of town sojourners were
hurrying back to their city homes.</p>

<p>Radnor experienced a strange feeling
of gladness when he caught
sight of the uneven roof lines of the
Knickerbocker town as he steamed up
the bay. And yet he expected no
one to meet him, and anticipated
taking up the old life just where he
had left off.</p>

<p>Nevertheless this sense of odd contentment
abided with him all through
the turmoil and confusion of arriving,
and sent him for the night to one
of the new palace hotels instead of
to his lonely quarters in the studio.</p>

<p>Had time cured the old wound, he
asked himself? But no; he knew
that could not be, and he expected
to wake up the next morning his old
self again.</p>

<p>But the morrow found him still
with the same inexplicable buoyancy
of spirit, and the business friends
whom he called on during the forenoon
congratulated him on the great
good his trip had done him. Among
the orders he received was one for a
sketch in Central Park, and early in
the afternoon he went up to the city’s
great pleasure ground to refreshen
his memory of it.</p>

<p>It was Saturday, and children
were everywhere. A crowd of them
of all sizes were eagerly gathering
around the Lohengrin boats as Radnor
strolled along the path that
skirts the pond.</p>

<p>The swan-like craft sent the young
man’s mind backward with a rush;
and yet in his present mood he did not
try to stem the current of thought.
On the other hand, he astonished
himself by stepping aboard one of
the boats for a sail. A nurse with
three young charges occupied the
seat with him, and had her hands
and eyes fully occupied in keeping
them all out of the water. Radnor
took pity on her at length, and offered
to take one of them, a little
girl, on his knee.</p>

<p>This arrangement delighted the
child, to say nothing of relieving the
nurse, and presently the little thing
began to prattle away to Radnor as
though he were an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you before,” she
presently announced, turning her
gaze from the water in front of them
to look up earnestly into his face.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not,” he answered,
smiling down into the deep blue
eyes, the brows of which now began
to knit in perplexed thought. “I
never saw you in my life before today,
so how could you see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did!” she persisted, “and
it was in a boat with a swan to it just
like this.”</p>

<p>Radnor started. What could the
child mean? She was certainly not
over six. It was not possible she
could remember that Lake Lorimac
incident of two years before.</p>

<p>“Where was it?” he asked. “Here
in Central Park?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, it was in a picture, and
Cousin Olive wouldn’t tell me where
the boat was, but she was in it too,
all dressed in white and—why, then
you must know Cousin Olive. I
wonder if you like her as well as I
do. Only she was cross—almost,
when Flo and I found that picture.
It was all wrapped up and—oh dear,
she told me never to tell anybody
and it would be all right, and now
I’ve told you. But you won’t tell, will
you?”</p>

<p>Radnor, however, was not compelled
to make a promise. The boat
at this point reached the landing
stage again, and the nurse carried all
her charges ashore with small ceremony,
the “polite gentleman” seeming
scarcely to notice that they were
gone.</p>

<p>He sat there perfectly still while
the boat made another tour of the
lake. He was recalling incidents
which he had thought never to recollect
again. One of them, that of the
photograph Miss Carew took of the
swan boat just before they started.
So Olive Bellman had kept this
secretly as a treasure, not as a forbidden
object. Radnor had met Mr.
Grant more than once and had been
asked why he did not call. What if—well,
what if there were two sides to
the picture, and money were to stand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
in the way of the happiness of the one
who possessed it because of pride in
the other?</p>

<p>How should he, Radnor Hunt, deal
with the problem?</p>

<p>This was the question that kept the
young artist’s thoughts active as he
strode homewards that afternoon.
The air was coming on chill as the
sun dipped towards the west, and the
dead leaves blew up about him spitefully
as he walked rapidly along, but
somehow it seemed to Radnor, as one
struck him in the face now and then,
as if they were not the withered remnants
of a dead summer, but the
hopeful blossoms of a dawning
spring.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br>
INSPECTOR SANDOFF.</h3>

<p class="dcap">Victor Sandoff, the Inspector
of that famous and dreaded
branch of the Russian police known
as the “Third Section,” was seated
in a cheerful room at his headquarters.
These, for the sake of
secrecy, were located in the second
floor of an old building which stood
on a narrow and little frequented
street not far from the Admiralty
Place. The house was guarded day
and night by police spies, and a secret
entrance in the rear permitted Sandoff
to enter and depart at will. As
the history of Sandoff is a somewhat
remarkable one, a few words concerning
him will not be out of place
at this point.</p>

<p>He was a man of tall and slender
build, with a light beard and mustache,
deep blue eyes, a ruddy complexion,
and an expression that had
a charm all its own. It betokened a
strong individuality and a rare depth
of character. At the time when this
history opens he was just thirty years
of age, and though possessed of a fortune
that yielded an ample income,
his time was devoted to the service
of the Bureau of Police. He had already
made his name dreaded among
the revolutionary classes of St.
Petersburg, and more than one unhappy
prisoner immured in the Fortress
dungeons, or plodding the snows
of Siberia, owed his arrest and conviction
to Victor Sandoff. He found
a keen zest in the pursuit of
criminals. In devoting his life to
this work he was actuated by motives
which none could question, for
his father, Colonel Sandoff, who was
Minister of Police at St. Petersburg
during a long period, had been
brutally assassinated ten years before,
presumably by the Nihilists
whose enmity he had incurred.</p>

<p>Though the assassins were never
discovered, Victor Sandoff became
more attached to his chosen profession
each year, partly from a desire
to avenge his father’s death indirectly—for
he had lost hope of finding
the real criminals after this lapse
of time, and partly because he had
inherited a natural aptitude for
police work, his grandfather, as well
as his father, having been identified
with that branch of the ministry in
his time. Sandoff was well educated
and possessed a fluent knowledge of
French and English, as well as his
own language. He was well fitted
to assume the high position that was
his in the social and military circles
of the Russian metropolis. He had
wealth, for the fortune left him by his
deceased mother yielded an annual
income of thirty thousand rubles.
But only on rare occasions was he
seen in the clubs or salons of St.
Petersburg, for the present state of
Russia kept the Bureau of Police
constantly on the alert. If Victor in
his own heart preferred the gayer
side of life he made no sign. He
was untiring in his labors, and possessed
the full confidence of the
Czar and of the ministry.</p>

<p>He had an uncle in St. Petersburg
with whom he was not on good terms
owing to causes which will appear
later. This was Count Sandoff, his
father’s brother, a man sixty years
of age, who divided his time between
the clubs, the gaming table, and his
yachts. He was reputed to be
wealthy, but though ostensibly the
owner of a mansion on the Court<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Quay and a country house on the
Gulf of Finland, his losses at cards
had covered his property with mortgages
to the full extent of its value.
Count Sandoff was living on the edge
of a volcano into which he was liable
to be precipitated at any day.</p>

<p>To return to Victor. His position
in St. Petersburg was a peculiar one.
As chief of the terrible Third Section
his power was almost unlimited. He
had his own force of men, and every
month a large sum of money was
placed to his credit in the Bank of
Russia for current expenses. He
was directly responsible to no one
but the Minister of Police. His assistant
and confidant in the affairs of
the Third Section was Serge Zamosc—himself
a very clever police agent.
Zamosc was a short, spare man, and
always wore his face smooth shaven,
the better to assume needed disguises.
He was about forty years
old, and had been in the service for
nearly one half of that period. It
was he who ferreted out information
for Sandoff, and then acted upon it
according to the latter’s instructions.</p>

<p>On this particular evening Inspector
Sandoff was in a complacent
frame of mind as he sat smoking a
fragrant cigar and sipping vodka
and water from a glass standing on
the table beside him. He was momentarily
expecting to hear of an
important arrest that would bring
no little credit to him and his department.
Felix Shamarin, a leader of
the revolutionary party, and the publisher
of its most incendiary newspaper,
had long evaded the utmost
vigilance of the police, who had been
endeavoring to arrest him for a
dozen offenses of which he was believed
to be guilty or cognisant.
Victor Sandoff’s men had at length
discovered that he had found a refuge
in a densely populated part of
St. Petersburg, lying between two of
the canals that intersect it. Since
early morning the cordon of police
had been tightening its lines about
the locality in which Shamarin was
supposed to be hiding, and it was
almost impossible that he could escape.</p>

<p>As he sat and waited for the expected
news, Sandoff’s thoughts went
back to a previous encounter he had
had with the set of Nihilists to which
Shamarin belonged—an encounter so
remarkable that every incident of it
was indelibly graven upon his
memory. He leaned back in his
chair, contemplating the bluish haze
of cigar smoke that dimmed the ceiling,
and dreamily reviewed the scene
as it passed before him.</p>

<p>At an early hour one morning, a
little more than a year before, he had
gone, with four of his men, to an obscure
quarter of the town to raid a
house believed to be the headquarters
of Shamarin’s seditious journal.
An entrance was forced, but the police
encountered a more stubborn resistance
than they had expected. There
was a fierce fight, and in the struggle
Sandoff’s forces became divided.
The leader himself laid low two of
the men who sprang upon him, and
a third antagonist turned and fled
before him. Sandoff’s blood was up,
and, his zeal outrunning his discretion,
he pursued the fleeing Nihilist
along a dark passageway, at the further
end of which the fugitive was
lost to sight. Stumbling blindly forward
in the almost total darkness,
Sandoff passed through a doorway.
Instantly the door closed behind him,
and he heard the sharp click of a key
turning in the lock.</p>

<p>The sound told him the peril of
his situation. He turned and grasped
the handle of the door, but could
not budge it. He felt along the wall—for
there was not a ray of light—and
to his dismay found that he was
in a small, square room, with no
means of exit—no avenue of
escape from the cruel and unscrupulous
men who held him prisoner.</p>

<p>As minutes passed by his hope of
rescue grew fainter and fainter. The
sounds of strife gave way to a complete
silence. His men must have
been outnumbered and overpowered
by the Nihilists, and it would be
hours before his absence would be
discovered by the police and reinforcements
sent to ascertain what had
become of him. Before that time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
his fate was sure to be sealed. He
could expect no mercy from his relentless
enemies, who would wreak
upon him a terrible vengeance for
their losses in the fight with the
police.</p>

<p>Sandoff had almost abandoned
himself to despair when he heard a
slight sound that seemed to come
from the wall behind him. He was
nerving himself to meet what he supposed
must be his executioner, when a
soft voice whispered:</p>

<p>“Make no noise as you value your
life!”</p>

<p>A hand grasped his arm, and drew
him toward a secret door that had
opened in the wall of his prison. A
faint gleam of light shone through it,
dimly revealing to Sandoff’s astonished
eyes the figure of a woman.</p>

<p>Mindful of her injunction, he followed
her noiselessly through the
secret doorway into a narrow
passage. She led the way around
several corners and down a winding
flight of stairs, finally pausing in a
small paved court hemmed in by
lofty brick walls.</p>

<p>The light here was still too dim to
reveal her face, but her figure was
slight and her voice was of singular
sweetness.</p>

<p>“I have saved your life, Victor
Sandoff,” she said to him, “and at
great peril to my own, as you will
believe. Some day I may exact a
similar favor of you. Will you grant
it if that time ever comes?”</p>

<p>Sandoff was influenced by the
tinge of romance that invested the
situation. He was deeply grateful
to the woman who had saved
him, so he readily promised to grant
whatever she might ask him.</p>

<p>“Swear it!” she said, and without
hesitation he took the required oath.</p>

<p>Then she led him by more than
one barred and bolted gate to a
street on the canal bank, and left
him there, vanishing without a word
and as mysteriously as she had come.
He knew his surroundings, and
quickly made his way to the nearest
police bureau, gathered a force of
officers, and returned as speedily as
possible to the house from which he
had just escaped. All was quiet
there. Sandoff’s four men were
found lying in the hallway, bound
and gagged, and all of them more or
less severely wounded. The
Nihilists, who had no doubt taken
alarm on discovering Sandoff’s escape,
had fled from the house, and
disappeared in the mazes of the
great city.</p>

<p>It was a year ago that these things
had happened, and though Sandoff
made diligent inquiry through his
men as to the identity and whereabouts
of the girl—for he was convinced
that she must be very young—he
never discovered the slightest
trace of her. Tonight, under the
fragrant influence of his cigar—which
may have been stronger than
usual—he found himself wondering
vaguely if the fulfillment of his
oath would ever be exacted, and trying
to recall the girl as she appeared
to him that night.</p>

<p>From this train of reveries he was
aroused by footsteps in the hall.
Then came a sharp rap on the door.
As the command to enter left Sandoff’s
lips Serge Zamosc stepped into
the room, followed by a short thick
set man, muffled to his ears in a
great coat. Zamosc’s manner gave
evidence of excitement. He glanced
at Sandoff, and then turned to his
companion, who stood awkwardly in
the center of the floor with his eyes
downcast and his hands pulling
nervously at his fur coat.</p>

<p>“This is the Honorable Inspector,”
he cried impatiently. “Now speak!
Tell him what you know. If you
have brought me here for nothing, it
will fare ill with you.</p>

<p>“I found this fellow in the street a
few moments ago,” he added to
Sandoff. “He insisted that he had
something of importance to communicate,
and as he would have
nothing to say to me, but insisted
on seeing you, I thought it best to
let him have his way. Possibly he
brings some news bearing on the
Shamarin affair.”</p>

<p>Sandoff turned to the man, whose
dress and appearance showed him to
belong to the lower classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” he said kindly.
“I am Inspector Sandoff.”</p>

<p>“I—I beg pardon, your honor,”
stammered the fellow appealingly.
“I—I must see you alone.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Sandoff.
“That is easily arranged.”</p>

<p>He led the man into the adjoining
apartment, which was the middle one
of the suite of three rooms which
formed the headquarters of the
Third Section. A third room adjoined
this, and like the one into
which Sandoff had just ushered his
visitor, it had a few chairs, a table,
and a cot, and was lighted by a small
barred window high up in the wall.
These two rear apartments had witnessed
many a tragic scene, for here
prisoners were often brought for
secret examination, and sometimes
confined for a day or two. The walls
were thick and the doors massive.</p>

<p>When Sandoff had shut off communication
with the front room by
closing the door, he turned questioningly
to the stranger, who was
sitting on the edge of a chair, with a
very pale face.</p>

<p>“Is it true, your honor,” began the
man finally, in a weak, quavering
voice, “that a reward of five thousand
rubles is offered for information
that will cause the arrest of Felix
Shamarin, the Nihilist?”</p>

<p>The fellow spoke the last words
glibly enough. He had evidently
committed them to memory.</p>

<p>“Ah!” thought Sandoff, “an informer?</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said aloud, “it is true that
such a sum will be paid—not for any
indefinite information, though. We
have already located our man within
a certain radius. Who are you, and
what do you know?”</p>

<p>“My name is Poussin,” replied the
fellow. “I have come to claim the
reward. Felix Shamarin is in hiding
at the house of one Lyapin, a locksmith,
who dwells on the bank of
the Fontana Canal, near the Ostroff
bridge. He intends to escape before
the break of another day, so you
must lose no time if you wish to take
him.”</p>

<p>Sandoff’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“Are you sure this information is
correct?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You can rely on it,” said Poussin.
“I am in a position to know. But I
trust that your honor will keep my
share in the matter a secret,” he continued
imploringly. “If it were
known, my life would not be worth
a kopec.”</p>

<p>“Have no fear,” said Sandoff. “If
you are betrayed it will be your own
doing. As for the reward, you will
get it in good time, provided your
information proves to be correct.”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a sudden
rap on the door, and when he walked
over and opened it slightly he saw
the face of his man Ivan, whose duty
it was to stand guard in the hall.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, your honor,” said
the servant, “but a lady is outside
demanding to see you. I told her
that you were busy, but she would
take no denial. She insists on speaking
with you, and refuses to go
away.”</p>

<p>“What does she look like?” asked
Sandoff, wrinkling his brow. “Has
she ever been here before?”</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge,” replied
Ivan. “Her face is covered with a
thick veil, but she appears to be
young.”</p>

<p>Sandoff hesitated for an instant.
The wrinkles deepened on his forehead,
and his hands trembled slightly
as they rested on each side of the
doorway.</p>

<p>“I will see her in a few moments,”
he announced abruptly. “Give her
that message, Ivan, and bid her wait
in the hall.”</p>

<p>As Ivan went back to the front
room, Sandoff closed the door and
turned to Poussin.</p>

<p>“You must excuse me for a moment,”
he said. “Some one is waiting
for a private interview with me. I
am going to put you in here,” leading
the way to the rear apartment, “and
as my agent Zamosc will be with
you, I must caution you to be silent
and to make no reply to any questions
he may ask you,” for it was
Sandoff’s custom to permit the identity
of informers to be known to none
but himself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
“I know better than to open my
lips,” returned the fellow shrewdly,
and the reply thoroughly satisfied
Sandoff. He left his companion and
passed through to the outer room.
Zamosc was sitting there by the desk,
perusing a newspaper.</p>

<p>“I must ask you to retire to the
rear room for a little while,” said
Sandoff hurriedly. “You heard Ivan
state that a lady wishes to see me. I
think I know what she wants. It is
some personal affair that should have
been arranged at my house, but since
she is here I may as well see her.”</p>

<p>“Don’t apologize, I beg of you,”
replied Zamosc. He walked quietly
back and entered the rear room,
where Poussin was already seated.</p>

<p>Sandoff followed him, and then
returned to the front apartment,
closing both doors. He walked to
the hall door and threw it open.
“You may come in,” he said. “I am
at leisure now.”</p>

<p>With a soft rustling of skirts a
woman entered. She glided to the
center of the room without a word,
and quickly removed her cloak and
veil.</p>

<p>Sandoff was thrilled with amazement
and admiration. His eyes
were riveted upon the slender figure
standing opposite him—so close that
he could have touched her by extending
his hand. He had seen many
beautiful women in his time, but
never one to match this young girl—for
she was scarcely more than
twenty. Her hair was of a rich
golden brown, her eyes gleamed with
a slightly darker shade of the same
color, from beneath long drooping
lashes; her cheeks were faintly tinged
with a hue like the early bloom of a
peach, and the ivory whiteness of
her neck and throat was only equaled
by the pearly rows of teeth that
showed through her parted lips as
she breathed quickly and deeply.
She wore a close fitting dress, made
of dark material and richly trimmed
with sable fur.</p>

<p>The two stood in silence for a
moment, and then, meeting Sandoff’s
eye, the girl blushed.</p>

<p>“You don’t know me?” she said
abruptly. “Do you remember the
night of the 30th of December, one
year ago——”</p>

<p>The sweet voice, the accent, revealed
the truth to Sandoff instantly.</p>

<p>“Yes; I remember now,” he said
gravely. “It was you who saved my
life.”</p>

<p>“And you remember the promise
you made me?” she continued.</p>

<p>Sandoff inclined his head. He was
greatly troubled by this visit, now
that he began to guess its import.
Yet he had no thought of breaking
his oath.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” he said.
“Speak! Don’t be afraid.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes sought the floor for
a moment, and then were turned to
Sandoff entreatingly.</p>

<p>“It is not for myself that I have
come here tonight,” she said. “I
want you to save the life of a friend—as
I once saved yours. Unless he
can leave the city before daylight he
is lost. Only one thing can aid him,
and that is a passport.”</p>

<p>“His name?” demanded Sandoff
quickly. “Tell me his name!”</p>

<p>The girl sank upon a chair and
buried her face in her hands. She
sobbed audibly for an instant, and
then looked up appealingly through
her tears.</p>

<p>“His name,” she replied in a
broken voice, “is Felix Shamarin.
He is my brother. I am Vera
Shamarin.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br>
THE TRIUMPH OF COUNT SANDOFF.</h3>

<p class="dcap">The effect of the girl’s brief words
upon Sandoff was startling.</p>

<p>His face suddenly assumed the color
of ashes; he retreated to his desk,
and stood there supporting himself
by one hand and looking down at
Vera Shamarin with an expression
that was hard to define—a glance of
mingled horror and pity.</p>

<p>The girl sprang forward and threw
herself at his feet.</p>

<p>“Save him! Save him!” she cried
incoherently. “He is my brother—all
that I have in the world. If he is
taken they will send him to Schlusselburg<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
or to Siberia—or perhaps even
worse.”</p>

<p>Sandoff drew back a little.</p>

<p>“Do you realize what you are asking
of me?” he said. “Do you know
that I could have granted you anything
rather than that?”</p>

<p>He spoke in a low tone and signified
to the girl to be equally cautious.
But she was in no mood for reasoning.</p>

<p>“Your oath! Remember your
oath!” she cried. “You dare not
break it. You must save my brother,
as you have sworn to do. It cannot
imperil you, for none will ever know
how he escaped. Give him such a
passport as you give to your own
agents when they are sent out of
Russia on police business. He will
be perfectly disguised, and the manner
of his escape will never even be
suspected.”</p>

<p>She looked at Sandoff, and seeing
no trace of pity or of yielding on his
stern features, she sank back on the
chair and gave way to a flood of
tears, her slender frame shaking with
emotion.</p>

<p>Sandoff fixed his eyes vacantly on
the floor. He was passing through a
tremendous mental struggle. He
could easily do what this girl asked
of him—but only at the cost of his
honor. He did not fear that his
treachery to the government would
be discovered—his power was too absolute
for that—but he knew that the
sting of conscience would be always
with him; that he would ever be reminded
by that self accusing mentor
of his unfitness to retain his high
position and the confidence of the
Czar. But on the other hand his
word was binding. He had sworn to
aid this girl to his utmost power—had
taken the oath with a full knowledge
of the straits into which it
might some day lead him, remote as
such a contingency seemed at the
time. Moreover, her tears and her
beauty now moved him to pity. He
deplored the fact that one so young
and fair should be connected with
the revolutionary party.</p>

<p>As he thus reviewed his unpleasant
situation, a clock on his desk struck
the hour of ten, and the girl rose
quickly to her feet.</p>

<p>“If you intend to save him you
must lose no time,” she sobbed.
“Your police are drawing closer
every moment, and he dare not leave
his hiding place without means of
getting away from the city. Do you
think that it cost me nothing to save
your life a year ago? You are mistaken.
My act was discovered, and
I was cruelly beaten. But for my
brother I should have been killed.
Do you still hesitate? If you care
nothing for your oath, I appeal to
your pity. Help me, I implore you,
and I shall be grateful as long as I
live. If you will send my brother
safely out of Russia, I promise you
that he shall never return. My influence
over him is great, and he will
do what I ask. Oh, help him—help
him for my sake——”</p>

<p>Her voice failed her. She stood
before Sandoff with her hands outstretched,
and the tears coursing
down her cheeks. He was visibly
moved by her misery.</p>

<p>“Have no fear, your brother shall
be saved,” he said gently. “I will
keep my promise, even at the sacrifice
of my honor. In return I ask of
you two things—that Felix Shamarin
shall never return to Russia, and
that none shall know what I have
done tonight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I promise,” she whispered
brokenly. “You may rely upon
it.” She caught his hand and
covered it with kisses, but Sandoff
quickly withdrew it, and, turning
away without a word, seated himself
at his desk. For a few moments
he wrote briskly, glancing from time
to time at the clock, while Vera’s
eyes followed every motion of his
own.</p>

<p>Finally he laid aside his pen and
handed her a folded paper.</p>

<p>“Here is a passport for your
brother,” he said quietly. “It is
made out fictitiously, of course, but
none will question the signature, and
if he is properly disguised there will
be no risk, either to him or to me.
At midnight a through train leaves
the Moscow terminus for Berlin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Let him take it, if possible. But are
you sure that he can pass through
the police lines in safety—my men
are very close to Lyapin’s house?”</p>

<p>The girl started violently. “Ah,
you know where he is concealed?”
she cried. “You are the most noble—the
most generous of men. Yes,
he can pass through in safety; there
is a way.”</p>

<p>She tried to say more, but her
voice choked with emotion. She
hastily donned her cloak and veil
and approached the door. Sandoff
preceded her.</p>

<p>“God bless you, Inspector Sandoff,”
she whispered.</p>

<p>The door opened and closed. Her
light footsteps echoed through the
hall and down the staircase. Then
all was silence.</p>

<p>When she had gone Sandoff remained
standing a moment by the
door, pressing his hands to his forehead
as though he would stifle the
conflicting thoughts that were
struggling for mastery in his brain.</p>

<p>Then he picked up a glass of vodka
from the table, and swallowed a little
of the strong spirit. The composing
effect of this was instantaneous. He
walked steadily across the floor and
threw open the door of the middle
room. An expression of relief appeared
on his face as he saw that the
apartment was empty, and the rear
door as he had left it.</p>

<p>“My fears were groundless,” he
thought. “Zamosc is the last man to
pry into private affairs.”</p>

<p>He opened the back room and
called the occupants out.</p>

<p>“I regret being compelled to keep
you waiting so long,” he said in
apologetic tones. “My visitor was
very importunate.”</p>

<p>“It makes no difference,” said
Zamosc; “but I am glad that you are
here all the same, for I have an important
engagement, and must leave
at once. It is already half past ten.
What about this stupid fellow
whom I brought here?” he added in
a low tone. “Does he know anything
of the Shamarin affair?”</p>

<p>“Nothing new,” replied Sandoff.
“He tells me that Shamarin is concealed
within half a mile of the Ostroff
bridge on the Fontana Canal—a
piece of information which we
have known for the past two days.
By the way, if anything turns up
before morning, let me know. I shall
remain here all night.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Zamosc.</p>

<p>He passed out of the room, and
his quick, firm footsteps were heard
descending the stairs.</p>

<p>Sandoff turned to Poussin, who
was seated on a chair, fumbling with
his cap.</p>

<p>“Follow me. I have something to
say to you,” he commanded.</p>

<p>He passed into the front room
with Poussin at his heels, and, stopping
before a ponderous iron chest
in one corner, unlocked and opened
the lid. He took out a roll of bank
notes—a portion of his private fortune,
received that morning from
his bankers—and, approaching the
table, counted out six thousand
rubles in full view of Poussin, who
watched the operation with sparkling
eyes. Then he passed them into
the fellow’s hand.</p>

<p>“Here is the reward for your information,
and an extra thousand
besides,” he said. “Put the money
away, and say nothing to any one of
what has occurred tonight. Do you
understand? You must keep the
information about Shamarin strictly
to yourself. If you disobey me you
will probably lose your money and
your life, too. Stay, you had better
not return to your home tonight. Go
to some other quarter of the city.
That is all. Remember my warning!”</p>

<p>Poussin stuffed the bank notes
into his pocket with a trembling
hand. His eyes were fairly bulging
from their sockets at the unprecedented
sight of so much money.
He would have fallen at the feet of
his benefactor, but Sandoff’s manner
forbade any such demonstration.</p>

<p>The latter was tempted for an instant
to ask the fellow if Zamosc
had remained in the back room with
him all the time, but a second later
he changed his mind. He had implicit
faith in his agent, and felt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
ashamed of the momentary suspicion
that had crossed his mind. He opened
the door, and Poussin shuffled out,
half crazy with joy, and went slowly
through the hall and down the
stairs.</p>

<p>Sandoff paced the floor a couple
of times, and then, drawing his chair
up to the lamp that was burning
cheerily on his desk, he lit a fresh
cigar and picked up one of the evening
papers. The clock unceasingly
ticked off the minutes, and the street
without, at first enlivened by the occasional
tread of a passer by, soon
became entirely deserted.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On this same evening, and while
Victor Sandoff was reading the St.
Petersburg papers at the headquarters
of the Third Section, his
uncle, Count Sandoff, was engaged
in a similar occupation in his luxuriously
furnished library of his stately
residence on the Court Quay. A
touch of gout had confined him to
the house, and his right leg was
propped on a couch surrounded by
soft pillows. Consequently he was
in an unusually vile temper, and this
frame of mind was aggravated by
the merry and continuous tinkle of
bells from the sleighs that were
speeding swiftly over the ice covered
waters of the Neva, and along the
frozen surface of the Quay.</p>

<p>Count Sandoff was a short, portly
man, some sixty years of age. His
features, once handsome and aristocratic,
had become coarse and bloated
by reason of many years of constant
and excessive dissipation. As
already stated, the count was on bad
terms with his nephew Victor, and
the cause of this estrangement shall
be explained.</p>

<p>When Victor’s mother died—shortly
before the assassination of
her husband—she left to the latter
her fortune, the income to be used
by him during his lifetime, and the
principal to revert to Victor at his
father’s death. But the property
was not legally tied up, and knowing
this, Count Sandoff, who needed
a large sum of money to retrieve recent
losses at the gaming table,
applied to his brother for a loan of
one hundred thousand rubles from
his deceased wife’s estate. Colonel
Sandoff refused the request absolutely.
He was a man of honor, and
knew how little chance there was of
the money being returned. Moreover,
some years before, when the
position of the brothers was reversed,
a similar request on his part—though
for a much smaller sum—had
been indignantly refused by the
count, who could easily have spared
the money at that time.</p>

<p>From this point dated the coolness
between the brothers; and when,
after the death of his father, Victor
came into possession of his inheritance,
the count’s animosity toward
his nephew deepened. He envied
the young man the possession of so
much wealth, which he fancied
should, at least in part, have belonged
to him. Indeed he went so far as
to enter into a conspiracy with one
of Victor’s own men—a very ambitious
and unscrupulous fellow—with
a view to accomplishing the
downfall of his nephew by whatever
foul means the course of events
might offer. Up to the present time
nothing had been accomplished, in
spite of the count’s influence, which
by the way was considerable. The
name of his assistant in this nefarious
plot was Serge Zamosc.</p>

<p>Perhaps the count’s thoughts were
dwelling on the family feud this
evening, for his face wore a bitter
expression as he pored over the
columns of the paper. Finally he
flung the sheet aside with a muttered
curse, and reached for a bell cord
with the intention of summoning his
servant. But before he could touch
it a shadow fell across the doorway,
and Serge Zamosc entered the room
with an ease of manner that showed
him to be a frequent and unannounced
visitor.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” said the count
curtly. “Sit down. Nothing new,
I suppose? Have a glass of wine?”</p>

<p>“Yes to the first question, no to
the last,” replied Zamosc quietly, as
he settled himself in an easy chair by
the count’s side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>“What! Has your clever brain
discovered a plan?” demanded the
latter, suddenly becoming animated.
“Do you mean to say that I shall
succeed at last—after all this time!
Don’t keep me in suspense. Explain
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Softly, softly,” replied Zamosc.
“I said nothing of the sort, did I?
But let us suppose that I <i>had</i> succeeded—that
I <i>had</i> discovered a sure and
speedy way of accomplishing your
object. Would you in that event be
prepared to carry out the agreement
you made some time ago?”</p>

<p>“You are concealing something,”
growled the count in reply. “Why
don’t you come to the point, Zamosc?
You know how impatient I am. But
stop—I will answer your question.
In case you had really accomplished
what you suggest, I would keep my
word to the letter. I would see to it
that you were appointed Inspector of
the Third Section, in place of my
nephew, and I would give you in addition
the sum of ten thousand
rubles.”</p>

<p>“But could you get the property
into your hands?” said Zamosc.
“The government, you know——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” replied the count
coolly. “The government usually
confiscates the property of condemned
criminals, but there are exceptions,
and this would be one of
them. I have already made my way
clear for that, and I am sure of receiving
at least one half of my
nephew’s wealth—if not more.”</p>

<p>“Enough!” rejoined Zamosc.
“Just sign this paper, will you?”</p>

<p>He passed the document to the
count, who read its contents with a
wrinkled brow. Then, after a brief
hesitancy, he took a pen from the
table, dipped it in ink and wrote his
signature at the bottom.</p>

<p>“You watch the loopholes
sharply,” he said, handing the paper
back.</p>

<p>“True,” replied Zamosc, “else I
should not be where I am. But now
to business,” he added. “The supposition
I mentioned a few moments
ago is not a supposition at all, but a
reality. I have in my possession
proof that will send Victor Sandoff
to Siberia for life, and that, too,
without any risk to us, for the proof
is genuine. We have been spared
the trouble of concocting a conspiracy.”</p>

<p>The count rose up, heedless of the
pain in his gouty leg.</p>

<p>“Is this true?” he cried sharply.
“Pardon me, Zamosc, but your story
seems incredible.”</p>

<p>“It is true,” replied Zamosc.
“Wait a moment. I will convince
you.”</p>

<p>He left the room and returned
shortly, followed by the man Poussin,
who had been waiting in the
lower hall. They drew their chairs
close up to the count, and Zamosc
related hurriedly the events of the
evening—how he had overheard, by
placing his ear to the crack of the
door, the whole conversation between
Inspector Sandoff and his fair guest,
and how he waited outside until
Poussin appeared and then compelled
him by threats to confess the
story of his bribery, and finally to
accompany him to the house of the
count.</p>

<p>As link after link in the chain of
evidence was revealed, the count’s
brutal eyes glowed with delight.</p>

<p>“Yes, we have him at last,” he
cried. “But I would not have believed
it of him, Zamosc—I swear I
would not. He has thrown himself
away for a woman—played right
into our hands.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Zamosc, glancing
at the clock. “He is lost. And now
for action. There is no time to lose.
Shamarin must be arrested, first of
all—the Moscow terminus will be
the place for that—and then we will
surprise the inspector at headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that is a good plan,”
exclaimed the count eagerly. “But
you had better let the gendarmes
make the two arrests. Go around
to the first station on the Nevskoi
Prospekt. You will find Captain
Nikolin in charge. He has men
there, and will act at once—a very
necessary thing, for it is half past
eleven o’clock now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“True,” said Zamosc, “and the
train for Berlin leaves at midnight.
Before morning the affair will be accomplished,
and within a month, at
the furthest, I shall expect a fulfillment
of your promise, my dear
count.”</p>

<p>“And you shall not be disappointed—if
my influence counts for anything.
Good night, and success to
you.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” rejoined Zamosc.</p>

<p>He hurriedly left the room, taking
Poussin with him, and a moment
later the two were striding hurriedly
along the Court Quay in the direction
of the Nevskoi Prospekt.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Although the St. Petersburg newspapers
seldom obtain any information
concerning the movements of
the police—at least not until it is
several days old—no less than two
of the morning journals announced,
in their issue for January 11, that
Felix Shamarin, the Nihilist, and his
sister, had been arrested on the previous
night at the Moscow terminus,
and that Inspector Victor Sandoff
was apprehended an hour later on a
charge of aiding the aforesaid Felix
Shamarin in his attempt to escape.</p>

<p>The assassination of the Czar could
hardly have created more surprise
and consternation throughout the
city, and when the true facts became
known, as they did in time, much
pity was felt for Sandoff, and not a
few expressed the opinion that he
could not have acted differently
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>But pity and public opinion have
nothing in common with the Russian
government. In spite of the
high rank of the offender, Victor
Sandoff was brought to trial three
weeks after his arrest, convicted,
sentenced to a term of ten years at
hard labor in the Czar’s Siberian
gold mines, and sent off post haste to
begin his term of banishment. He
attempted no defense, nor would any
have been possible. The testimony
of Zamosc and Poussin was beyond
question, and the passport that had
been taken from Shamarin was a still
more damning bit of evidence.</p>

<p>Felix Shamarin and his sister had
left St. Petersburg on the way to
Siberia ten days earlier—for the devoted
girl, despite her youth and
beauty, was sentenced to share his
punishment for the part she had
played in his attempted escape.
Neither of them was aware of Sandoff’s
arrest. They believed that his
perfidy was responsible for their own
fate, and their hearts were full of
bitterness and hatred toward him.
Nor did Sandoff in turn know what
had become of the Shamarins. All
information was refused him. He
rightly attributed his downfall to
Serge Zamosc, but he was ignorant
of the connection between the latter
and his uncle, Count Sandoff. Not
for an instant did he suspect the
truth.</p>

<p>Two weeks after Sandoff’s conviction,
the papers briefly announced
that the ministry had appointed
Serge Zamosc to fill the vacant office
of Inspector of the Third Section,
and a short time later it was
rumored in club and social circles of
the city that his Imperial Majesty
the Czar had been graciously pleased,
for family reasons, to permit one
half of Victor Sandoff’s estate to revert
to Count Boris Sandoff. So all
the actors in the Shamarin affair received
their reward. Zamosc attained
the height of his ambition and the
sum of ten thousand rubles, Count
Sandoff replenished his bank account
and entered on a fresh course of dissipation,
and the rest—went to
Siberia.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br>
THE GOLD MINES OF KARA.</h3>

<p class="dcap">In the background a murky, leaden
colored sky. Outlined against
it, ranges of low hills scantily clad
with stunted larches and pines
and whitened by a light fall of snow.
At their base a stream, narrow and
rapid, brawling between scattered
rocks and huge shapeless mounds of
gravel and sand. In the foreground
a straggling village of whitewashed
cabins and long barracks of unpainted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
logs, with a few more pretentious
houses with tin roofs, and a black,
weather beaten log prison, in the
open space before which stand a
group of Cossacks in sheepskin boots
and dark green uniforms, leaning
moodily upon their Berdan rifles.</p>

<p>Such was the scene on a dreary
January morning in that portion of
the Siberian gold mine settlements
known as Middle Kara.</p>

<p>Within the gloomy prison the convicts
have answered to the morning
roll call, and are now taking their
breakfast of weak tea and rye bread.
A moment later the heavy doors are
thrown open and the mournful procession
files out, a haggard, toil worn
group of men, wearing long gray
overcoats with yellow diamonds on
their backs. The Cossacks shoulder
their rifles, surround the convicts
front and rear, and at the sharp
word of command from the officer in
charge, the column is moving briskly
up the dreary valley to begin another
day’s relentless toil.</p>

<p>A sad and hopeless place is this
valley of the Kara River, lined at
intervals, for a distance of nearly
twenty miles, by the prisons and
settlements that constitute the Czar’s
convict mines. The mines themselves
consist of a series of open
placers, stretching at irregular intervals
along the Kara River—a river
in name only. From these placers
the convicts extract yearly, by the
sweat of their brow, about 3,600
pounds of pure gold—all of which
goes into the Czar’s private purse.
The misery and suffering of the unfortunate
beings who are condemned
to spend their days here in hard
labor, is not unknown to the civilized
world. It need not be dwelt upon
further.</p>

<p>Among the group of convicts who
marched up the valley in the gray
wintry light of this particular morning
was one whose figure had not
lost its straightness, nor his face its
look of conscious pride, in spite of
the wretchedness he had endured for
two long years. But his features
were haunted, nevertheless, by an
expression of suffering that might
have defied recognition from any
who knew Victor Sandoff in the days
when he was the famous Inspector
of the terrible Third Section. Two
years had come and gone since his
arrest and conviction—one year of
monotonous journeying across
Siberia, and one year of toil, day by
day, in the gold placers of the Kara
River. He had nothing to look forward
to but a long vista of slavery—terminated,
perhaps, by an unmarked
grave among the Siberian hills, or at
the best by a return to Russia in
poverty, disgrace and degradation,
to spend the remainder of his life
shunned by all men. Strange irony
of fate, that this man whose signature
had sent many a poor wretch to
Siberia, should come at last to the
same place! Many of those by
whose side he worked from day to
day owed their arrest and conviction
to him, but none knew him, nor
did he know them. The gray convict
garb makes its wearer only an indistinguished
unit in the army of
slaves.</p>

<p>His thoughts—and terrible they
must have been at times—Victor
Sandoff kept well beneath the surface.
His face was always grave,
impassive, set in that rigid expression
which sometimes awed his companions,
and impressed even the
rude Cossacks.</p>

<p>On this morning his keen blue eyes
had a far away look as he plodded
over the frozen clods of snow, for it
was two years to a day since the fateful
10th of January that had witnessed
such a change in his life, and
he could not help recalling the series
of events that had wrought his undoing—the
visit of Zamosc and
Poussin, the interview with Vera
Shamarin, and the abrupt entry of
the gendarmes into his room with
the terrible order of arrest.</p>

<p>Thus absorbed he failed to note his
surroundings—the squads of mounted
Cossacks who galloped by or
were seen at a distance, winding
over some barren hill top, the eager
mutterings of his companions, and
the excited interest of the guards
who had the convicts in charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>At sunrise that morning, while he
was yet lying on his hard bed, half
awake, half asleep, he had heard the
dull boom of a cannon echoing
through the valley, and now when a
second report thundered among the
hills, he glanced up, curious to know
what it meant.</p>

<p>A brief exchange of words between
the Cossack officer and one of his
men—who were marching close by—gave
him the wished for information.</p>

<p>“There goes another gun,” said
the latter. “The fugitive must be
still at large.”</p>

<p>“They will soon capture her,” returned
the other, with a harsh laugh.
“It is seldom that a man gets five
miles away from the valley—what
can a woman hope to do?”</p>

<p>A woman, then, had escaped!
Sandoff was conscious of a vague
hope that the poor creature might
elude her pursuers—a hope that he
knew could never be realized. It
was a frequent thing for convicts
to break away from the mines, but
they either perished from cold and
hunger or were ultimately brought
back to endure aggravated miseries
in expiation of their offense. The
knowledge of this deterred many
who could easily have accomplished
a temporary escape. What would
have been the use? It was five
thousand miles to St. Petersburg,
and a good thousand to the Pacific
coast. Every foot of the way was
beset by incredible perils.</p>

<p>The scene of the day’s toil was
reached after a march of an hour—for
it lay three miles from the settlement.
Without delay the men were
put to work under the keen eye of
the overseer, while the Cossacks
stacked their rifles and built fires,
about which they gathered, stamping
their feet and clapping their arms
together, for the weather was bitterly
cold and the snow was beginning to
fall thickly from the leaden sky.</p>

<p>With pick and shovel the convicts
delved into the stratum of clay and
gravel beneath which lies the bed of
gold bearing sand—sometimes at a
depth of twenty feet. The frozen
clods of earth were taken in charge
by others, who loaded them on rude
wheelbarrows and trundled them
away. At a spot some little distance
down the stream, a bed of sand, uncovered
on the previous day, was being
washed out in the wooden hoppers.</p>

<p>The biting cold compelled the
men to work with more than their
usual energy, and all were hungry
when the time for the scanty noonday
lunch arrived. They drew as
close to the fires as the Cossacks
would permit, and ate their bread
and drank their weak tea, sitting on
the snowy ground.</p>

<p>Sandoff found himself opposite
a man who interested him strangely—a
tall, slender fellow of about his
own age, with dark hair, piercing
black eyes, and an expression that
was moody and even desperate, as
though the burning remembrance of
his wrongs was always taunting him.</p>

<p>Two nights before this man had
been placed in the prison cell occupied
by Sandoff and two others,
having been transferred to Middle
Kara from one of the lower settlements.
He had maintained a dogged
silence ever since, and Sandoff had
more than once found the stranger’s
eyes fixed upon him with a strange
earnestness of gaze.</p>

<p>The man ate the last morsel of his
bread and washed it down with his
tea, glancing casually at Sandoff as
he did so. Suddenly his face flushed
and a tigerish look came into his eyes—a
look of hatred and recognition.
The Cossacks were some distance
away, and before they could note
what was going on, much less take
any action, the fellow sprang to his
feet and hurled himself on Sandoff,
clutching his throat in a vicious
grip.</p>

<p>“I know you, I know you,” he
cried in passionate accents. “I
can’t be mistaken. You are Inspector
Sandoff. It was you, you traitorous
dog, who deceived my sister and
decoyed me from my hiding place!”</p>

<p>In an instant all was wild excitement.
The convicts gathered
eagerly about the scene of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
struggle, but were speedily thrown
aside by the guards, who tore the
combatants roughly apart, the one
senseless with rage, the other stunned
and bewildered.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded Sandoff
in a troubled voice.</p>

<p>“You should easily guess,” replied
the other bitterly; “but I will tell you
my name. I am Felix Shamarin.”</p>

<p>A strange look came into Sandoff’s
eyes, and he shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“You do well to attack me,” he
said. “Could not your own eyes
have told you the truth? What,
think you, brought me here? It was
the passport I gave your sister on
that night two years ago. I am
suffering for her sake, and for yours.
Did you know nothing of it?”</p>

<p>Shamarin drew a short, fierce
breath. His face changed color,
and a tear forced itself into each
eye.</p>

<p>“As God is my witness,” he said
with emotion, “I did not know of
this thing. I thought it was you
who betrayed us—your perfidy that
decoyed us to the railway station.
And so the fulfillment of your oath
to Vera proved your ruin! I wish
to God she had never gone near you
on that night. It were better for me
to have been caught and to have
suffered alone. Can you ever forgive
me?—I must seem to you the
basest, the most ungrateful of men.
My sudden passion when I recognized
you destroyed my reason, else
I must have suspected the truth.”</p>

<p>“It was but natural,” replied
Sandoff gently. “Say no more.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward and took the
hand that Shamarin extended to him.
For a moment the two men were
united by a common bond of misery,
despite the great gulf that had
separated their lives in former days.</p>

<p>The Cossacks had paid no attention
to this brief conversation, but
just at that moment their officer,
Lieutenant Zagarin, pushed his way
to the spot with a flushed and angry
face.</p>

<p>The cause of the quarrel mattered
not to him, nor did he make any
distinction between the offenders,
though it was perfectly plain that
Shamarin had been the aggressor.</p>

<p>“You mutinous dogs!” he cried
harshly. “You deserve to be shot.
I will be lenient this time—but beware
in future. Chain these men to
their barrows,” he added, turning to
the Cossacks, “and put them to work
in that spot yonder, where the soil
is so hard. See that they get no
supper when they return tonight—or
on the following night either.”</p>

<p>Remonstrance or explanation
would have been worse than useless.
The officer’s command was speedily
obeyed, and in a short time Sandoff
and Shamarin were working by
themselves in a small hollow on
the western side of the river, opposite
their companions. A single
Cossack was detailed to guard
them.</p>

<p>The stratum of gravel was unusually
hard at this point, and they
found the labor very severe as they
dug out the clods with their picks
and conveyed them to the water’s
edge in the wheelbarrows. The
watchful eye of the Cossack was
upon them, and conversation was
out of the question.</p>

<p>The hollow in which they were
working was square in shape, bounded
on one side by the river, and on
the other three sides by a bluff about
fifteen feet high, the top of which
was covered with dense, scrubby
bushes. Being a little way down
stream this hollow was beyond the
scrutiny of the Cossacks or of the
labor gang, and the two toilers were
in range of only one pair of eyes,
the property of the solitary Cossack.</p>

<p>This individual was disposed to
regard his position as somewhat of a
sinecure. He had no fear that his
captives would run away, for they
were securely chained to their wheelbarrows.
Nor did he imagine that
they would quarrel, for with his own
eyes he had seen the reconciliation
between them. His duty was to keep
them at work, and as this did not require
his presence on the exact spot
he varied the monotony of his employment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
by marching up and down
that portion of the river shore which
commanded a view of the hollow,
and by gazing fiercely at Sandoff or
Shamarin when they approached
with a load of clods. The snow was
now an inch thick on the ground,
and as the afternoon waned it came
down still more persistently, blowing
to and fro in blinding flurries.</p>

<p>The men could have conversed
with safety, since the Cossack was beyond
earshot, but neither felt in the
mood for speech. The cold was so
intense that their only refuge from
it was in hard and incessant work.
They had just returned from wheeling
a load of clods to the river,
and as they drove their picks into
the hole they had excavated a ringing
sound came to their ears. Glancing
around, they saw the Cossack
place his rifle against a rock and
bend down toward the water, tin cup
in hand, with the evident intention
of procuring a drink.</p>

<p>That instant a stone, thrown from
above, struck Shamarin smartly on
the arm. His sudden exclamation
startled Sandoff, and both glanced
up to see a face peering dimly over
the edge of the bluff between the
parted bushes.</p>

<p>“Be cautious,” whispered a feminine
voice of singular sweetness.
“Keep your heads down and pretend
to be working, but don’t lose a
word I say.”</p>

<p>Shamarin staggered and nearly
dropped his pick.</p>

<p>“My God!” he muttered hoarsely,
“it is Vera—my sister!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is I, Vera,” came the reply
from above. “Is your companion
to be trusted? Quick!”</p>

<p>Shamarin instantly regained his
self possession.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is all right,” he replied.
“Go on. I am listening.”</p>

<p>The Cossack was still bending
over the water. It took him a long
time to find a suitable drinking
place.</p>

<p>“Here, take this,” said the girl.
She threw down a short thin package,
which Shamarin deftly caught
and hid in his bosom.</p>

<p>“You heard the cannon this morning?”
she continued quickly. “They
were for me. I escaped last night
from the women’s prison at Ust
Kara. I will explain all later. I
have been watching here all day.
Tonight you must escape. Remove
a board from the floor of your cell—that
packet contains tools which will
help you. Come directly to this
spot. I have plans which I will explain
then. Don’t be alarmed about
me. I am warmly clothed, and have
a safe hiding place.”</p>

<p>“If possible we shall be there,”
replied Shamarin. “I think your
plan will work—but if anything
happens and we don’t come, give
yourself up. I have a strange thing
to tell you. This man here, my companion,
is——”</p>

<p>“Hush! hush! the Cossack is returning.
Good by—until tonight.”</p>

<p>Vera quickly withdrew her head
and Sandoff and Shamarin plied their
picks with trembling hands and
agitated faces, as the Cossack came
quickly forward, shouldering his
rifle. He had evidently received
some signal from his companions,
for as he reached the spot he said
gruffly: “The lieutenant has ordered
a return. The snow is becoming too
deep to do good work.”</p>

<p>He conducted his temporary
prisoners out of the hollow, and
across the shallow stream on the
scattered stones. A few moments
later the convict gang was marching
back to the settlement. At least two
of their number bore lighter hearts
than had been theirs when they
started from their cells that morning.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br>
A DARING ESCAPE.</h3>

<p class="dcap">The convict prison at the settlement
of Middle Kara was a
long, low, single story building, so
situated that one of its longer sides
fronted upon the street, while the
other opened on a square courtyard
surrounded by a high stockade. Of
the two narrow ends one faced
another street, and the other was
backed by the pretentious tin roofed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
dwelling belonging to the commander
of the prison. The interior
of this wretched building, which
sheltered nightly from one to two
hundred convicts, was dirty and foul
in the extreme, and was apportioned
into <i>kameras</i> or sleeping cells,
holding anywhere from four to a
dozen men apiece. Sandoff and
Shamarin occupied one of the smaller
apartments and shared it with two
other prisoners, Butin and Vraskoi
by name.</p>

<p>Thus, when they returned that
night from the mines and were locked
up in their dreary cells, they
found themselves confronted by a
very perplexing question—how to
dispose of Butin and Vraskoi.</p>

<p>At present they gave no thought
to what lay beyond the first and most
important step—the escape from the
prison. It was enough for Shamarin
to know that his sister had some
possible plan in her head—some plan
that offered a fair chance of overcoming
the terrible obstacles that
usually confronted fugitives who
tried to escape from Siberia, and especially
at this time of year—the
dead of winter. He had sufficient
faith in Vera to believe this, and
patience enough to act and wait.</p>

<p>As for Sandoff, the possibility of
escape thrilled and cheered him and
left no room in his heart for the
dark side of the question. He, too,
had faith in Vera. His past experience
had taught him something
of her strength of character.</p>

<p>As there was little opportunity for
conversation, Shamarin conceived a
course of procedure and boldly took
the initiative. When the four had
eaten their supper—for the lieutenant’s
harsh order concerning
Sandoff and Shamarin was for some
reason not carried out—and were
lounging on the hard platforms before
retiring, Shamarin revealed the
whole affair to Butin and Vraskoi.
He felt safe in doing this, for both
were political prisoners and had a
high sense of honor.</p>

<p>The result was satisfactory. As
concerned themselves, Butin and
Vraskoi refused to entertain for a
moment any project of escape at
such a time of year, but they cheerfully
offered to assist their companions
to the best of their ability,
although by so doing they would
lay themselves open to severe punishment.</p>

<p>“It will be nothing worse than a
deprivation of food, or being chained
to our barrows for a week or so,”
remarked Vraskoi. “We can endure
that easily enough. Surely you
would do the same in our place.”</p>

<p>This was quite true, and the services
of the two brave men were reluctantly
accepted.</p>

<p>While waiting for the prison to
quiet down and the night guard to
go on duty, Shamarin told Sandoff
that his sister had been confined for
the past year in the female prison at
Ust Kara—which was the most
southerly of the settlements. He
had seen her but once in that time,
on which occasion, three months
before, they had mutually agreed to
try to escape during the approaching
spring, and attempt to make their
way to Vladivostok on the Pacific
coast.</p>

<p>“Why she has chosen this time to
escape I do not know,” concluded
Shamarin. “But depend upon it
she has a good reason. I know her
well enough for that.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” replied Sandoff.
“God willing, we will join her before
midnight.”</p>

<p>“It will be a partial reparation for
what we have made you suffer, if
through her efforts you get safely out
of Siberia,” rejoined Shamarin. “It
will be a terrible blow when she
learns of your misfortune. She will
reproach herself bitterly.”</p>

<p>“That will be needless,” said
Sandoff. “Fate willed that we
should suffer in this way. Your
sister saved my life. Could I have
acted otherwise than I did? But let
us dismiss the past and think only of
the future. It will be better.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” assented
Shamarin. “We will think only of
the future.”</p>

<p>The conversation then ceased, and
as all the prisoners were supposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
by this time to have gone to sleep,
Sandoff and Shamarin stretched
themselves on the hard platform
beside their companions. For some
time sounds of voices and the shuffling
of feet came from the main
portion of the prison, but finally,
about nine o’clock in the evening,
everything became quiet, save for the
occasional tramp of a Cossack sentry
in the corridor without the cell. This
signified that the commander of the
prison, his staff of officers, and in
fact all residing in the settlement of
Middle Kara—except the night guard
of Cossacks—had retired to rest.
The time for action had arrived.</p>

<p>None of the inmates of the cell
were sleeping. They rose noiselessly
to their feet and gathered about
Shamarin as he drew the package
given him by Vera from his pocket.
Outside, in the courtyard on which
the cell faced, the sentries had built
fires, and these sent a dull reflection
through the grimy panes of a window
high up in the wall. The packet
proved to contain a long, sharp
bladed knife and a short, flat iron
wedge—tools well fitted for the proposed
undertaking. How the brave
girl had acquired them it was impossible
to guess.</p>

<p>Shamarin made a brief examination
of the floor, which fortunately
was old and rotten. Choosing a
likely spot, he set to work with such
energy and skill that in less than five
minutes two planks had been pried
loose, and a dark hole was revealed,
through which came a damp and
musty odor. All this was accomplished
without a particle of noise.
Meanwhile Sandoff had been doing
up in a neat bundle the blankets and
change of clothes belonging to himself
and Shamarin.</p>

<p>“Now is our time,” said the latter.
“Come, Sandoff, delay may be
fatal.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you had better go at once,”
added Butin. “It will be safer—though
the chances are that your absence
will not be discovered until
morning. It is very seldom that the
guard looks into our cell of a night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, as far as that goes you are
safe,” added Vraskoi. “The critical
point is to get clear of the prison
without detection.”</p>

<p>“That will be easily managed,”
said Shamarin. “The weather is in
our favor. Come, let us start!”</p>

<p>The parting with Butin and Vraskoi
was a sad one. Good wishes
were exchanged and hands were
clasped in a friendly embrace.
Then Shamarin lowered himself into
the hole, followed by Sandoff, and
the planks were forced into place
over their heads.</p>

<p>The first step had been safely accomplished,
and the fugitives were
now in a hollow place about three
feet high and extending under the
entire prison, for the building had
been erected on piles above the
ground. This space was full of dirt
and filth that had been dropped in
through holes in the floor, and was
surrounded on all four sides by a wall
of heavy logs roughly plastered together.</p>

<p>Shamarin knew the location of the
prison well, and had formed his
plans accordingly. Bending low he
groped his way forward, with Sandoff
by his side, until he came in contact
with the wall of logs. With his
knife he picked out some of the dried
plaster from the chinks. Putting his
eyes to the fissure thus formed he
could see into the stockaded courtyard
of the prison. Through the
snow, which was still falling, the
forms of half a dozen Cossacks
loomed darkly as they stood about a
blazing fire, warming their limbs. A
stack of rifles was visible close by.</p>

<p>“All right! I have my bearings
now,” whispered Shamarin. “Keep
close to me and don’t make any more
noise than you can help.”</p>

<p>He groped his way along the wall
until he reached the angle. Turning
this he pushed on for half a dozen
yards or more. Then he stopped,
and asked in a low whisper, “are you
there, Sandoff?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” came the instant reply.
“Where are we?”</p>

<p>“On a line with the side street,”
answered Shamarin. “The next step
is to remove a log. Here, take this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
wedge and help me to pick out the
plaster.”</p>

<p>By feeling with his hands Shamarin
chose a log suitable for the purpose,
midway between the ground
and the prison floor, and both attacked
it vigorously but noiselessly.
In less than half an hour the plaster
that held it in place was removed, as
far as was possible, and by their combined
efforts, one using the knife and
the other the wedge, one end of the
log was pried inward until they could
grasp it with their hands.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment. Before
proceeding further Shamarin peeped
out through the crevice. The narrow
vista afforded only a brief view of
snow covered ground, but as all was
quiet he plucked up heart and
dragged the log entirely out of its
setting. It toppled into the inclosure
with a slight crash.</p>

<p>Both men thrust their heads out
together, and drew them back as
quickly with a startled jerk. An
armed Cossack was standing on
guard along the prison wall not ten
feet distant.</p>

<p>The imminence of the peril
staggered the fugitive for an instant.
They believed that the Cossack had
heard the falling log, and expected
him to put in an appearance at any
moment. The latter part of this
supposition was verified almost
instantly, and before any plan of
action could be decided upon.</p>

<p>The sentry had <i>not</i> heard any noise,
for the wind was blowing in the
opposite direction, but at the very
moment when the fugitives thrust out
their heads he decided to exercise his
stiffening limbs. With long strides
he advanced, bowing his head before
the driving snow. In this attitude
the dark gap in the prison wall
caught his eye, and with more of
curiosity than suspicion he bent down
close to the mysterious hole and
peered into it. He could not see the
fugitives, but the conviction that
something was wrong quickly forced
itself into his mind, and he opened
his mouth to summon the officer of
the guard.</p>

<p>Too late! A pair of muscular
arms darted lightning like through
the opening, and the unlucky
Cossack was seized by the throat and
dragged bodily out of the snow and
through the narrow opening. Still
holding his victim by the throat, so
that no outcry was possible, Shamarin—for
it was he who had performed
the daring deed—struck the Cossack’s
head forcibly against the end of the
log. His struggles ceased, and he
lay quietly on the ground.</p>

<p>“Not dead, is he?” asked Sandoff
fearfully.</p>

<p>“No, only stunned,” replied
Shamarin. “Help me to bind him,
quick! Every moment that we stay
here increases our peril.” As he
spoke he tore the Cossack’s leather
belt from about his waist and proceeded
to sever it in two, lengthwise,
with the knife.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop for that,” said Sandoff.
“The officer of the guard makes
a round every few moments. If he
comes by now we are lost.”</p>

<p>“True!” exclaimed Shamarin. “I
had forgotten that—what shall we do?
It is important that this sentry be
put out of the way, as you will see
later. Stop! I have an idea. Put
on this fellow’s cap and coat, shoulder
his rifle, and mount guard outside,
keeping your back up against the
hole.”</p>

<p>“A good plan,” replied Sandoff
approvingly. “I will do it.”</p>

<p>Shamarin handed him the cap and
cloak and he quickly donned them.
They fitted his tall figure well. Then
he crept hurriedly into the snowy
street, picked up the rifle that the
Cossack had dropped, and assumed a
rigid martial attitude. Opposite
him was a row of low buildings, dark
and silent. To his left, around the
angle of the prison, the narrow street
opened on the square, and to the
right it extended through the outskirts
of the settlement to the Kara
River. Not a living creature was in
sight.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed and no word
or signal came from Shamarin.
Then a quick crunching sound fell
on Sandoff’s ear, and he had barely
time to divine its meaning when a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Cossack officer rounded the angle of
the prison and approached him on a
brisk walk.</p>

<p>Sandoff nerved himself for the
ordeal. His cap was far over his
eyes and the cape of his coat came
well up about his ears, so he had
little fear of recognition. He presented
his rifle respectfully as the
officer reached the spot. The latter
contented himself with a nod and a
brief glance, and was about to pass
on when the rattle of hoofs echoed
down the narrow street. Hearing
this he stopped not six feet from
Sandoff, and waited.</p>

<p>Presently half a dozen mounted
Cossacks loomed out of the driving
snow, and clattered down the street
until they were opposite the prison.
Then, catching a glimpse of the
officer, their commander ordered a
halt, and while the horses pranced
restlessly from side to side, a brief
conversation took place between the
two.</p>

<p>“What luck, Captain Petrof?”
asked the officer of the guard.</p>

<p>“None whatever, lieutenant,” was
the reply. “The girl has probably
perished from exposure by this time.
Her body will be found after the first
thaw.”</p>

<p>From this Sandoff inferred that the
squad of Cossacks had been scouring
the country in search of Vera. His
ears were on the alert to catch every
word, though at the same time he
was enduring agonies of suspense
lest the prying eyes of the Cossacks—which
were frequently turned
toward him—should discover the
gaping hole in the wall that he was
trying to hide.</p>

<p>The next question touched on a
still more interesting subject.</p>

<p>“By the way, lieutenant,” said
Captain Petrof suddenly, “I want to
call your attention, while I think of
it, to a grave mistake that was made
a day or two ago—though it only
came to my knowledge this morning.
You know the convict Shamarin,
who was brought up from the
lower prison? Well, by some blunder
he was placed in the same kamera with
Sandoff, the one time Inspector of the
Third Section. You know the connection
between them—and by the
way, it was this same girl that got
Sandoff into trouble who escaped
last night—the sister of Shamarin,
you know.”</p>

<p>“That was indeed a serious blunder,
Captain Petrof,” replied the
lieutenant. “I will rectify it at once.
I will remove Shamarin to another
cell.”</p>

<p>“It will do the first thing in the
morning,” suggested Captain Petrof.</p>

<p>“No, I will attend to it tonight,”
returned the lieutenant firmly, “as
soon as I have finished my round of
inspection.”</p>

<p>The captain chirruped to his horse
and the squad of Cossacks trotted
off toward the barracks across the
prison square, while the lieutenant
pushed on without a glance at Sandoff
and soon disappeared around
the corner of the stockade.</p>

<p>The alarm and consternation of
the latter at what he had just heard
may be easily imagined. As he turned
hurriedly a log was thrust endways
through the hole behind him,
and was followed an instant later
by Shamarin.</p>

<p>“Have you heard?” whispered
Sandoff huskily. “Our escape will
be discovered. They will enter the
cell in a few moments.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Shamarin coolly, “I
heard all. I am sorry now that I
wasted so much time with that fellow
in there. I wanted to make sure
that he would not alarm his companions
and put them on our track.
I have him nicely gagged and bound.
Now my trouble goes for nothing.
But don’t despair, Sandoff. We will
make good use of what time we may
have. Here, help me to put this log
in place—then we will be off.”</p>

<p>Sandoff lent a willing hand, and
the break in the wall was soon
roughly closed up.</p>

<p>“They will find that fellow long before
morning,” said Shamarin. “He
is in no danger of being buried alive.
Are you ready now? Just keep that
Cossack coat and rifle. They may
do you good service in the future. I
will carry the other bundle, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
knife and wedge. We may need them
all. Is the breast of that coat you
have on filled out with cartridges?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Sandoff, making a
hasty examination.</p>

<p>“Good!” said Shamarin. “It is a
strong point in our favor to have
firearms. That rifle may save us
from starvation—and from Cossacks,”
he added significantly.</p>

<p>Then, with a last glance at the
gloomy prison, they quickly crossed
the street, and plunged in among
the rows of squalid huts, keeping a
sharp lookout for danger. But on
such a stormy night no one was
abroad except in the vicinity of the
prison, and after winding in and out
among the narrow streets of the
settlement, the fugitives reached the
suburbs. Presently they came to the
bank of the Kara River, where they
stopped for a breath of free air—the
first they had enjoyed in two long
years.</p>

<p>“It is possible that the lieutenant
has changed his mind, and won’t enter
the cell until morning,” said
Shamarin, at this point, “but we
won’t take any chances. The snow
is now about half a foot deep, and
it is not coming down fast enough
to conceal our tracks in case our
flight is discovered within the next
hour. We should be traced to this
point at once.”</p>

<p>“Then what can we do?” asked
Sandoff uneasily.</p>

<p>“Only one thing,” was the reply.
“Wade up the shallow bed of the
river. It is only partly frozen, owing
to the swiftness of its current. The
Cossacks may suspect our ruse, it is
true, but they will follow the stream
southward down the valley, and not
to the north, in which direction we
must go. But come! Vera will be
expecting us.”</p>

<p>Without hesitation they waded
into the icy waters and worked their
way up stream, keeping close to the
shore, where it was quite shallow,
and sometimes stepping from one to
another of the rocks that, covered
with snow and ice, rose above the
surface of the current.</p>

<p>Two full hours were required to
traverse the two miles and a half that
separated the settlement from the
gold placers where the convicts had
recently been working, but at last
the ungainly heaps of sand and
gravel began to appear here and
there. Peering through the falling
snow Shamarin descried at a little
distance the hollow where his sister
had promised to await their coming.</p>

<p>Forgetful of pain and fatigue they
pressed on, and as their weary feet
trod the soft snow that carpeted the
shore of the river, a dull report
echoed through the night and
shattered the stillness of the valley.
Then another, and another—each
seeming louder than the last.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br>
DOWN THE SHILKA.</h3>

<p class="dcap">No need to tell the fugitives the
meaning of the booming
cannon. It was all plain enough.
Their escape had been discovered,
and in a few moments mounted Cossacks
would be riding to and fro
through the snowy night. From one
end of the settlement to the other
the news would spread, and all would
be on the alert for the escaped
prisoners.</p>

<p>“If we only could have had one
night’s start,” panted Shamarin, as
he plunged forward through the
drifted snow into the mouth of the
little hollow. “But the case is not
hopeless by any means. Keep your
spirits up, Sandoff.”</p>

<p>Then he uttered a glad cry as a
figure muffled in heavy furs rose from
behind a rock and came swiftly
forward.</p>

<p>“Vera!”</p>

<p>“Felix, my brother!”</p>

<p>They fell into each other’s arms
and embraced passionately for a
moment. Then in a few words
Shamarin revealed the identity of his
companion, and Vera’s sorrow and
remorse on learning the truth were
pitiful to see. She bitterly reproached
herself for Sandoff’s misfortune.</p>

<p>“Believe me, you are not to blame,”
said Sandoff gently, when he had
told her all the circumstances. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
entreat you to let it cause you no
distress. It is all past now, and we
have too much at stake to think of
anything but the future.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” added Shamarin.
“Be sensible, Vera, and think
of what lies before us. We must act
promptly if we would elude the
Cossacks who will soon be scouring
the valley. I am impatient to hear
your story. Some strong motive
must have prompted you to escape
at such an unfavorable time. I
have enough faith in you to be convinced
that you acted for the best.”</p>

<p>“I did,” replied Vera with forced
calmness. “A few words will explain
all. The women’s prison at
Lower Kara has been overcrowded
of late, and I discovered accidentally
that the governor intended to send
some of the inmates to Irkutsk in a
few days. I was to be included in
that number. As this would have
separated us forever, I determined
to escape and then try to get word to
you, for I knew that you had been
transferred to Middle Kara. I escaped
from the prison at night by a
broken window, and went straight to
the homes of the Free Command—to
some people whom I knew in the
prison, and who had been released on
parole while I was there. These
noble people—who once belonged to
the Revolutionary Committee, but
before your time, Felix—gave me
stout boots, an abundance of warm
clothing, a pistol and ammunition, a
supply of food, even a little money,
and the tools that I gave you yesterday.
But this is not all. They gave
me information that is more valuable
than their gifts, for without it an
attempt to escape at this time of
year would be madness indeed.
They told me that on the bank of the
Shilka River, less than a mile below
the Kara, lives a peasant who has a
large boat, and some miles down the
Shilka, just before it empties into the
River Amur, stands a hut hidden in
a dense wood. This hut was used
last fall by some poor fellow who
escaped from the mines. He stored
a quantity of provisions there, intending
to wait until spring and then
strike for the coast; but one day
when he had ventured out in search
of game the Cossacks caught him
and brought him back. But the hut
was not found, and the store of
food is probably still there. My
friends gave me written directions
for finding the hut, but I have not
time to show them to you now. And
so do you see my plan, Felix? We
must get the boat, float down the
Shilka River to this hut, and live
there until spring opens. Then we
will do our best to reach Vladivostok
on the Pacific coast, and once there
we shall surely find, among the
vessels of all nationalities in the
harbor, one that will help us and bear
us away to some free country.”</p>

<p>“It is a noble plan,” cried Shamarin.
“My brave girl, I believe it
will succeed. The obstacles in the
way are many, but we won’t stop to
consider them now. We will try to
look continually at the bright side.
The first step is to reach the mouth
of the Kara River, which is about
eight miles distant, as nearly as I
can judge. Unfortunately, to get
there we must pass three of the
settlements, commencing with Middle
Kara, but we can do so in comparative
safety by making a circuit.
Let us strike across the valley from
here, so as to avoid the Kara River
and the settlements, and then follow
the ridge southward. That will
bring us to the Shilka, and by tracing
it for a short distance we shall
come to the house where lies the
boat. As yet the snow is not deep,
and if we travel rapidly we can cover
the distance by two o’clock in the
morning. The danger of pursuit
during that period of our escape is
slight, for the snow will obliterate
our footsteps before the Cossacks
can trace us to this point. The chief
danger lies in our track being discovered
by prowling squads.”</p>

<p>“And that is very improbable,”
said Sandoff. “It need not cause us
much uneasiness. Your plan is a
good one, Shamarin. Let us lose
no time in carrying it out!”</p>

<p>“We can start at once,” exclaimed
Vera. “Wait until I get my things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>She led the way to the top of the
bluff, and showed them the spot that
had served her as a hiding place for
the past twenty four hours—a dry,
sheltered nook among rocks and
dense bushes.</p>

<p>Shamarin took the bundle that contained
her supplies—Sandoff assuming
charge of the other package—and
then at their top speed the little
party of three crossed the Kara by
the bridge of stepping stones, and
headed due east across the valley.
Its level surface—barely two miles
wide—was crossed in safety, and
after ascending the range of low
foothills, the fugitives turned to the
south and followed the line of the
ridge. The wisdom of Shamarin’s
plan now became apparent, for but
little snow had forced its way through
the young timber, and they were able
to travel rapidly. The successive
settlements were passed at a distance.
Twice the crisp air bore to the
fugitives the muffled tramp of hoofs,
but the sounds remained at a distance
and finally faded away.</p>

<p>At length, about two o’clock in the
morning, as near as could be guessed,
the lights of Ust Kara, the settlement
nearest to the mouth of the
river, showed them that the first stage
of their journey was nearly at an end.
They felt no fatigue. Even Vera had
indignantly refused her brother’s offer
of assistance, and in spite of the
bitter cold they were all fairly warm
from the brisk speed at which they
had been traveling.</p>

<p>Presently the ridge began to slope
downward until they were on level
ground; and after crossing a belt of
pine forest, less than half a mile
wide, they emerged on a low bluff
and the River Shilka was below
them. For a moment they contemplated
the scene in silence, and not
without some dread, for the pale
glow of the moon showed the river
to be clogged with huge cakes of ice,
whirling down stream with a great
grinding and crashing, while each
shore was frozen solidly for a distance
of some yards from the bank.</p>

<p>“It will be perilous work,” muttered
Shamarin to himself, “perilous
work!” Then he said aloud, “Well,
now for the next step. In what direction
is that to be? Up stream or
down?”</p>

<p>“Down, I think,” replied Vera.
“We are hardly a mile from the
Kara as yet. The house must be
close at hand, though.”</p>

<p>“Down it is, then,” said Shamarin.
He led the way to the beach and
thence along the snow covered pebbles,
until, on rounding a sharp bluff,
the fugitives caught sight of a tiny
cabin standing near the water’s edge,
in the shadow of a clump of pine
trees.</p>

<p>Shamarin crept forward alone to
investigate, and presently came back
with a joyful face.</p>

<p>“All right,” he announced; “no one
is stirring in the cabin, and I have
found the boat. Follow me with as
little noise as possible.”</p>

<p>The boat was lying in a rude
covered shed within a yard or two
of the river, and had not been used
for so long a time that its keel was
frozen tight. The united efforts of
the two men freed it, and then they
began to drag it over the intervening
section of beach, very slowly and
cautiously, for the cabin was not ten
yards away. When they got it on
the belt of firm ice it moved more
easily, and they pushed it forward,
sounding each step of the way until
it was almost on the edge of the
whirling black water. The boat was
apparently in good condition, and
had three seats, one in the middle
and one at each end. The owner
had probably used it to ferry passengers
across the river.</p>

<p>Then Sandoff went back to the
shed, and returned with two long,
iron pointed boat hooks and a pair
of paddles.</p>

<p>“Now get in, Vera,” said her
brother, “and Sandoff and I will
push the boat into the water and
make a leap for it.”</p>

<p>But the girl drew back and took a
shining gold coin from her pocket.</p>

<p>“Wait just a moment,” she entreated.
“I want to give this to the poor
man who owns the boat. We may
be taking away his only means of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
livelihood. Perhaps we shall need
the money, but it is better that he
should have it.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply she
sped swiftly over the ice and up the
beach. The two anxious watchers
saw her reach the cabin and stoop in
front of the door.</p>

<p>She rose and started back, but before
she could take three steps a dog
began to bark furiously from within.
The brute had scented the presence
of an intruder.</p>

<p>Vera came swiftly down the beach,
and bounding over the ice sprang
lightly into the boat. Another instant
and the two men had pushed it
free of the edge, springing safely in
as it settled deep in the black water.
Each seized a boat hook, and as they
prodded and lunged at the great ice
cakes that struck the little craft on
all sides, and threatened to grind it
to fragments, the door of the cabin
opened and a man appeared on the
threshold—a frowsy looking peasant,
only half clad. His dog, a small
noisy cur, slipped between his legs
and ran down to the shore, where it
stood and barked hoarsely at the retreating
boat.</p>

<p>The man stooped and picked up
the coin, but at first he did not comprehend
what had taken place.
When his dull faculties finally grasped
the truth, he ran down to look
into the shed, and then began to
shout loudly, gazing out upon the
river. Evidently the money did not
console him for the loss of his boat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the strong current was
bearing the fugitives rapidly down
stream at imminent risk of an upset,
for the boat swirled in every direction,
now sinking deep in the water,
now rising high on the drifting ice
cakes.</p>

<p>“That noisy fellow and his dog
will prove our ruin,” muttered Shamarin.
“Their cries can be heard at
Ust Kara.”</p>

<p>“Courage, courage!” whispered
Sandoff. “We will soon be out of
sight and reach. Careful now, my
friend! Below us the river narrows
and flows close to rugged hills.
There we shall be likely to encounter
a swifter and more dangerous current.”</p>

<p>As they skillfully guided the boat
onward, striving to keep it headed
with the tide, both heard distinctly,
above the roar of the water and the
grinding of the ice, a quick, dull
noise strangely like the galloping of
horses.</p>

<p>Vera heard it too, and started from
her seat in alarm. All three forgot
for a moment the nearer and more
imminent peril, and turned for a look
at the spot they had just left. The
moonlight shone brightly on the
cabin, and on the man and dog
standing by the shore, and then its
pale rays fell on foaming horses, and
rifle barrels, green uniforms, and
bearded faces, as a troop of Cossacks
spurred at top speed around
the bluff and out on the broad
stretch of shore.</p>

<p>At sight of that dread body of
horsemen they shivered and felt that
hope was indeed gone. Sandoff was
the first to fling off the lethargy of
despair. His mental eye showed him
what chances were favorable and
what unfavorable. Besides, he would
rather have died than submit to recapture.</p>

<p>“Don’t despair,” he whispered
sharply to his companions. “We
have a chance yet—and a good one.
The country below us looks rugged,
too rough for the Cossacks to traverse
with any speed. If the current continues
as it does now, we shall easily
distance them. Help me to get the
boat toward the other shore as far as
possible, Shamarin; they may take
it into their heads to fire at us.”</p>

<p>The latter obeyed unquestioningly,
and with some trouble the boat was
headed obliquely across the current.
Then the terrific struggle began anew—the
battle with the waves and the
impetuous ice floes that constantly
menaced the destruction of the craft
and its inmates, only to be flung
sullenly to one side by the skilled
hand of Sandoff or Shamarin. Slowly
the boat made headway toward the
desired shore, and Vera cheered the
men in their labors by timely words
of encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>But by this time the ferryman had
given the Cossacks all the information
they needed, and at the sharp
word of command from their officer
they spurred down the shore, unslinging
their rifles as they rode,
until a timbered bluff, jutting into
the river, stopped further progress.</p>

<p>The boat was now well toward the
other shore, and some distance down
stream, but it was still within sight
and range. Just as the fugitives
dropped flat by Sandoff’s hurried command,
a straggling volley was fired,
and the leaden bullets plowed into
the ice cakes and splashed in the
patches of black water. But the
boat was untouched. A moment
later the current swept it around the
curve, and the danger was past for
the present.</p>

<p>“Now head it straight—straight
with the tide,” said Sandoff. “There!
That’s it. Let it take its own course
now. All we need do is to keep it
trim and fend off the ice.”</p>

<p>The Shilka was at this point less
than a quarter of a mile wide, and
the fugitives saw with delight steep
ridges falling sheer into the water on
each side of them.</p>

<p>“If this keeps up,” said Shamarin,
“and if the snow storm lasts and
grows heavier, as it shows promise of
doing, the Cossacks will be compelled
to give up the chase. That is
one advantage of escaping in the
dead of winter—the troops are useless
during and after a heavy snow
fall.”</p>

<p>The snow was indeed coming down
more rapidly, and in small, thick
flakes that boded long continuance.
The fugitives began to suffer terribly
from cold.</p>

<p>More peril was close at hand—in
spite of predictions to the contrary.
The boat stuck for a time on a projecting
reef of rocks, and when it
finally floated off again, and had
passed down stream for half a mile
or so, the steep banks suddenly
fell away. Though a continuation
of them was visible some distance
off, in the interval was a stretch of
open country. As the boat drifted
out from the shadow of the hills, the
ominous thud of hoofs was heard a
second time, and down a slight declivity
rode the Cossacks at full
speed. The relentless pursuers had
made a circuit and ridden hard to cut
the fugitives off. The officer in
command came down to the shore,
and descrying the approaching boat
he made a trumpet of his hands and
shouted hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Come in here at once! If you
refuse we will riddle you with bullets.”</p>

<p>“Don’t reply,” whispered Sandoff
to his companions. “The situation
is critical, but not altogether hopeless.
For my part I prefer the
chances of being shot to giving myself
up. You know what lies in
store for us if we are taken?”</p>

<p>“We will go ahead by all means,”
whispered Shamarin, and Vera was
of the same mind, showing not a
particle of fear.</p>

<p>So, without deigning to answer the
Cossack, who had by this time repeated
his threat, the fugitives dropped
below the gunwales, and the
boat was allowed to take its own
course.</p>

<p>For half a minute there was deep
silence and then the valley echoed
with ringing reports. Crack!—crack!—crack!—crack—!—crack!
So
it continued intermittently as the
Cossacks quickly loaded and fired,
and the boat drifted on its course
with provoking slowness. It was a
terrible ordeal through which the
three crouching figures were passing.
The hissing bullets fell everywhere,
plowing furrows and holes in the
ice cakes, splashing water over the
sides of the boat, and not infrequently
imbedding themselves in the
timbers of the little craft. Had it
been closer to the left shore, none of
its inmates could have escaped—for
the Cossacks were fair marksmen,
and kept up the fusillade with untiring
persistency. Fortunately no
bullets struck very close to the
water line, but Sandoff was grazed
on the thigh and had his cap shot
off, while Shamarin was hit in the
fleshy part of his left arm.</p>

<p>At last the firing became less continuous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
dwindling down to a few
stray shots. When a full minute
passed in silence, Sandoff ventured to
lift his head, and saw that the boat
had once more passed into the
shadow of the overhanging hills. He
drew his head back, cautioning his
companions to do the same, for if
they could put the Cossacks under
the impression that all three had
been killed, it would greatly increase
their chances of ultimate escape.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br>
THE FLIGHT.</h3>

<p class="dcap">The fugitives crouched thus for
twenty minutes or more. Then,
as the boat could ill spare their attention,
and was being driven dangerously
among the ice floes, the two
men seized the boathooks and stood
up.</p>

<p>The Cossacks and the open country
had both disappeared. Dark,
gloomy hills encircled the river as
far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>Sandoff noted with satisfaction
that the snow was still falling thickly.</p>

<p>“If we can reach the hut that you
speak of,” he said to Vera, “we shall
be quite safe as far as pursuit is concerned.
The cold is our greatest
enemy now.”</p>

<p>“We must fight it off,” replied the
girl. “Even with this swift current
we cannot reach the hut before tomorrow
afternoon, for it lies very
near the point where the Shilka and
the Amur River meet.”</p>

<p>“How shall we know the place,
Vera?” asked her brother.</p>

<p>For answer she produced a tiny
scrap of paper covered with close
writing. While Shamarin held a
lighted match over her shoulder, she
read the contents aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You will pass a small island in the
center of the river, on the crest of which
grow four big pine trees. Just below this
island, on the left bank of the river, is a
narrow ravine among thickly wooded hills.
Pursue this for a quarter of a mile, and
you will find the hut on your right. It
lies among rocks and pine trees.</p>

</div>

<p>“That has a cheerful and definite
ring to it,” remarked Sandoff. “It
is a pleasant prospect to look forward
to—a sheltered hut among the hills,
and in a wild and desolate spot,
where the Cossacks will never think
of looking for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” said Shamarin.
“The valley of the Shilka is a lonely
region. If we find this hut, we can
safely remain there for some weeks.
If we run short of food, there is game
in the forest.”</p>

<p>Conversation gave way to silent
watchfulness as the boat drifted on
through the long, dark hours of the
early morning. When daylight came
the misty outlines of the hilly shores
showed dimly through the driving
snow. There was little to be feared
from the Cossacks under such circumstances,
so the fugitives continued to
float down the center of the stream,
keeping a sharp lookout, nevertheless,
on each bank.</p>

<p>Soon after noon an island hove in
sight in mid stream. Four tall pine
trees stood on its crest, and when
they had passed this and driven the
boat far to the left shore, a dark,
narrow ravine was visible, with
wooded hills on each side. This was
the place, beyond doubt, so they
landed on the rim of firm ice, and
were about to send the boat adrift
when Sandoff interfered.</p>

<p>“We had better make sure, first,
that the cabin is here,” he said. “I
will go up the valley and search for
it. If I am successful I will give a
sharp whistle. Then turn the boat
bottom up—so that the Cossacks, if
they find it, will think we have
perished—and send it adrift. Then
follow my footsteps up the ravine.”</p>

<p>This wise plan was carried out.
The others watched Sandoff as he
plodded up the ravine, almost waist
deep in the drifted snow, and ten
minutes later a shrill whistle came
distinctly to their ears. Taking out
the bundles, they cast the boat adrift,
bottom up, and followed the path
Sandoff had taken.</p>

<p>Vera’s information proved to be
correct. Slightly more than a quarter
of a mile from the river, they met
Sandoff just starting back to meet
them.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have found the hut,” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
said. “It is close by, and in a splendid
location.”</p>

<p>He led them on for a few yards,
and then turned up the hill to a thick
cluster of pine trees and scattered
rocks. In the very center of this
was what they sought—a small,
square cabin, strongly built. It was
provided with a door and a window,
both of which were tightly closed.
An entry was effected with little difficulty,
and the fugitives examined
the interior with growing delight
and amazement. In one corner of
the floor lay a great heap of withered
grass, and a rude closet in the
wall held a plentiful supply of dried
meat and a lump of brick tea. Everything
was just as the former occupant
had left it on the morning when
he went away in search of game—never
to return. A heap of ashes
lay in the fireplace, and near by were
some plates and a cup rudely fashioned
out of wood.</p>

<p>“Nothing could be better suited
to our purpose,” said Shamarin.
“Here we can live in safety, for the
ravine will soon be choked up with
snow and no one can come near us.”</p>

<p>“Let us have something to eat,”
suggested Sandoff. “I am nearly
famished.”</p>

<p>That night was one to be remembered.
In spite of the bitter cold
outside, the interior of the cabin was
snug and comfortable, and the fugitives
slept in peace until the sun
was far up. They were well provided
with coverings, for in addition to
their warm clothing each had a
heavy blanket—Vera had brought
one for herself—and Sandoff owned
two overcoats, his own and the one
taken from the Cossack.</p>

<p>On the following morning Shamarin
partitioned off one end of the
cabin for Vera’s use, taking timber
for that purpose from a pile that lay
outside among the pine trees. It was
all drift wood—of which material the
cabin itself was made—and the poor
fellow who built it must have dragged
every piece up the ravine from the
river. The tools used in its construction
were found in the cabin—a
small blunt axe and a rusty saw.
Vera knew nothing of the identity of
the builder, but the fact of his having
these tools showed pretty conclusively
that he had belonged to the Free
Command.</p>

<p>The fugitives now settled down to
a manner of life that was painfully
dreary and monotonous. For three
whole days it snowed. On the fourth
night a small avalanche dropped
from the hillside above, and, crashing
through the pine trees, completely
buried the cabin. This
proved to be a rather fortunate
thing, for from that time on the little
dwelling was snug and warm. After
half a day’s labor the men opened
communication with the outer world
by means of a tunnel leading from
the cabin door. At night they slept,
and during the day they whiled away
the time by conversation and story
telling. Not once, however, did
either Sandoff or Shamarin touch on
his past life. By tacit consent that
subject was always avoided. Each
felt that it was better to forget the
great gulf that had once separated
them—better to remember only that
they were comrades now, with the
same perils and the same hopes.</p>

<p>So the days passed into weeks, and
the weeks went by until February
was half gone. Food was getting
scarce, and all three grew so heart-sick
of their cheerless life that a
change of almost any sort would
have been welcome. One evening
when they were all sitting about the
fireplace, where a few sticks of wood
were burning for the purpose of light,
Sandoff said abruptly:</p>

<p>“I have come to the conclusion,
my friends, that we had better leave
this place at once and begin our
journey to the Pacific. I will explain
my reasons,” he continued, as
his companions gave him their
earnest attention. “In the first
place, as you know, alternate slight
thaws and heavy frosts have put a
crust on the snow that will easily
bear our weight, while horses would
break through it at once. Two
months of winter yet remain—a
period which is usually one of steady
cold—and I maintain that during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
these two months is the best time for
us to travel. The way to Vladivostok
leads down the valley of the Amur
River. That is really the only path
we can take. As you know, the
great Siberian post road also follows
the windings of the stream. Of
course we will keep back among
the foothills, and at this time of
year, when the post road is little
traveled and but few persons are
abroad, the danger of discovery
would be lessened. If the crust remains
on the snow we should be able
in two months to cover the thousand
miles that separate us from the
Pacific. Moreover, if my plan succeeds
we shall reach Vladivostok in
the early spring, when vessels from
foreign countries are coming into the
harbor, and when those that have
wintered there are preparing to
depart. If, on the other hand, we
remain here until spring, our progress
will be delayed by melting
snows and swollen streams, and we
shall reach Vladivostok at a very
bad season. Still, there are many
obstacles in the way of an immediate
start—the cold, the difficulty of finding
shelter at night, and the necessity
of procuring food.”</p>

<p>Sandoff had hardly ceased when
Shamarin leaned over and clasped his
hand.</p>

<p>“You’ve taken the words right
out of my mouth, comrade,” he said
eagerly. “I have been thinking of
that very thing for the past week or
so, and I agree exactly with what
you say. As for the obstacles you
speak of, we are warmly enough clad
to defy the cold. Caverns and bushes
will give us shelter by night. We
can find an abundance of small game,
and now and then pick up food from
the friendly peasants who live along
the post road. The sooner we start
the better—that is my firm opinion.
As for Vera, no doubt she is of the
same mind.”</p>

<p>“I am,” exclaimed the girl eagerly.
“I am anxious to start at once.
The journey holds no terrors for me.
You know that, Felix?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it,” returned her
brother proudly. “I know you have
twice as much courage and endurance
as most men.” At which remark
Vera blushed and drew back
into the shadow.</p>

<p>So the question was settled without
further discussion, and at daybreak
on the following morning the
fugitives were up and preparing for
the eventful journey. That preparation,
as may be imagined, was very
slight. Shamarin possessed quite an
inventive faculty, and in less than an
hour he constructed a long flat
sledge, rudely but strongly put together.</p>

<p>“This will serve to carry our baggage,”
he said, “or any one of us
who may be worn out or unable to
walk. Moreover, if we come to any
long, smooth inclines we can all get
on board and go sliding down.”</p>

<p>The blankets, extra clothes, and
the small quantity of food that remained,
were put up in a neat
bundle and strapped to the sledge.
Sandoff took the rifle and ammunition,
and Shamarin the pistol.
Then, with a last look at the dark
cabin where so many weary days
had been spent, they passed through
the door, closing it behind them, and
thence along the hard trodden tunnel
to the outer air. The day was
just two hours old when they started.
The sun was shining brightly,
and the hard, frozen crust that
covered the snow sparkled like
myriads of diamonds. They turned
up the eastern side of the ravine,
pulling the sledge lightly behind
them, and stopped for a moment on
the summit of the ridge to admire
the view that lay before them—range
after range of snow topped
hills as far as the eye could reach.
Then briskly and with light hearts
they started away and traveled for
hours up one hill and down another—keeping
the Shilka River constantly
in sight—until the sun was far toward
the horizon. The country was
desolate and deserted; so when they
chose a stopping place in a deep,
wooded hollow, they did not hesitate
to build a cheerful fire. This was
kept up all night, Sandoff and Shamarin
mounting guard by turns. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the morning the march was resumed,
and during that day the fugitives
crossed the Shilka River, very near
its mouth, by means of an ice gorge
that had formed during the previous
night. An hour later they were
tramping along the shore of the
Amur, the vast watery highway
that flows to the Pacific coast. It
was now a sheet of ice, and as the
Siberian post road—marked by the
long line of telegraph poles—skirted
the shore, the fugitives made haste to
draw back into the forest.</p>

<p>From this time dated a period of
progress and security which lasted
for three weeks. Day after day they
traveled on down the valley, keeping
as far back from the river as possible,
and during all this time they met
not a single human being. The snow
crust remained firm, and they made
fair progress, covering about fifteen
miles every day. At night they
suffered much from cold—for sometimes
villages were close at hand and
they dare not make fires—but they
found sufficient shelter to prevent
them from freezing.</p>

<p>They nearly starved, however, in
spite of the birds and hares that
Shamarin skillfully succeeded in
trapping. When they halted on the
twenty second night after leaving the
hut, in a thick wood overlooking the
Amur, it was evident that a crisis
had been reached. They were worn
out with incessant traveling, faint
and sick from hunger, and all the
shelter they had was this strip of
wood—their only food a couple of
raw quail.</p>

<p>For themselves the two brave men
cared little, but that Vera, whose lips
never uttered a word of complaint,
should have to endure such suffering
was more than they could stand.
Especially aggravating to them tonight
was the sight of the post
station, a mile away, where lights
shone cheerily through the twilight
from houses in which men were eating
and drinking and sitting by
warm fires.</p>

<p>“Something must be done,” declared
Sandoff earnestly. “We can’t
stand this another day. We must
have nourishing food or we can go
no farther.”</p>

<p>“And where shall we get it?” asked
Shamarin moodily. “The outlook
is bad enough. We have come
less than one third of the distance,
and still have seven hundred miles
before us.”</p>

<p>For once Vera had no words of
cheer for her companions. She knew
they had defined the situation truly,
and that nothing she could say
would help them. Her eyes sought
the ground sadly and remained
there, fixed with repugnance on the
miserable birds that Shamarin had
taken from his snares that morning.</p>

<p>“Yes, something must be done,”
repeated Sandoff, “and without
delay—tonight. I will go down and
reconnoiter around yonder post
station. If I don’t return soon you
need not be alarmed, for I intend to
be very careful.”</p>

<p>His companions made no attempt
to dissuade him, except that Shamarin
offered to go in his place. But
Sandoff would not hear of this.</p>

<p>“It is best for me to go,” he said
firmly. “My knowledge of government
regulations at these post stations
will help me if I get into a
tight place.”</p>

<p>He hurriedly exchanged the coat
he was wearing for the dark green
Cossack cloak—knowing that he
would attract less attention if seen
in this guise. The muff shaped fur
cap he had been wearing constantly,
and when Shamarin handed him the
rifle he looked a thorough Cossack
soldier. The deception was still
further assisted by the tangled beard
and mustache he had grown since his
escape from the mines. Thus equipped
he bade farewell to his companions,
and struck off at a rapid
pace through the forest. He had no
definite purpose in view—merely a
vague hope that he might in some
manner procure a supply of food.</p>

<p>The post station was less than a
mile distant. By following a ravine
covered with thick bushes, Sandoff
came out in the rear of a little cluster
of houses bunched together on both
sides of the post road—the station<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
itself with the square courtyard in
front, the telegraph office and half a
dozen tiny cabins across the way.
A careful glance showed him that no
one was in sight and that only one
light was visible—a yellow glimmer
shining from the rear window of
the post station. Toward this Sandoff
directed his steps, moving slowly
and cautiously over the snow
crust.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br>
THE POST STATION.</h3>

<p class="dcap">The post station was simply a
square log building with a
stockaded court yard in front. The
first floor was thrown into one room,
and when Sandoff approached the
rear window with noiseless tread,
and raised his eyes slowly above the
sill, he beheld a scene of cheer and
comfort that fairly made his heart
ache. In one corner, near the door,
stood a large iron stove, heated to a
fiery redness. In the center of the
room was a table laden with bread,
meat, pickles, a bottle of vodka and
a steaming samovar of tea, and
around it sat three men, evidently
Siberian merchants, drinking and
eating. In the corner of the room
opposite the stove lay a Buriat
peasant and a dog, sleeping side by
side, and on a bench by the door sat
the <i>starosta</i> or station keeper. The
window sash was raised half a foot,
no doubt because of the extreme heat
of the room.</p>

<p>While Sandoff was trying to catch
the fragments of conversation from
within, the distant tinkle of sleigh
bells fell on his ear. The sound
came nearer and nearer, now mingled
with the tramp of hoofs. Sandoff
left his position and crept to the
angle of the house, reaching it just
in time to see a long covered sledge
drawn by a <i>troika</i>—three horses
harnessed abreast—come spinning
along the post road from the west,
and draw up before the court yard
gates.</p>

<p>“Some one bound for the Pacific,”
muttered Sandoff. “I wonder who
it can be.”</p>

<p>Curiosity had by this time mastered
his hunger, so he crept back to
the window and looked once more
into the room. The <i>starosta</i> had
gone out—no doubt to welcome the
new arrival—and the three merchants
were looking inquiringly toward the
door. The Buriat and the dog still
slept profoundly.</p>

<p>A moment or two later the <i>starosta</i>
returned, followed by a short spare
man muffled up in furs. His face
was clean shaven, and his black,
bead-like eyes twinkled at sight of
the fire and the well spread table.</p>

<p>Sandoff shot one glance at the
stranger, and then drew quickly
away from the window and leaned
against the end of the house. His
hands were clinched, his face black
with passion, and he panted fiercely
for breath.</p>

<p>“I know him,” he muttered. “<i>It is
Serge Zamosc!</i> What can that
scoundrel be doing here? I would
give my chances of escape to put my
hands on his throat for one moment.
But this won’t do—I must be calm.
I must find out the meaning of this
strange thing. To think that the
traitor should turn up here in
Siberia! How easily I could shoot
him through the window!”</p>

<p>Repressing the temptation to do so—but
not without difficulty—Sandoff
once more put his eyes to the window.
Zamosc was standing near the
stove, talking in a low tone to the
<i>starosta</i>. At that instant the door
opened, and a Russian officer in undress
uniform entered the room—evidently
the head official of the village.</p>

<p>He favored Zamosc with a slight
bow, and said abruptly. “I beg your
honor’s pardon, but I must trouble
you for your passport.”</p>

<p>Zamosc glanced at the other occupants
of the room and then led
the officer directly to the window,
pausing within two feet of Sandoff,
who drew his head down and turned
his ear upward. Zamosc began to
speak in a low voice, but from the
fragments that reached him, such as
“traveling in secret,” “Inspector of
Police,” “government report,” Sandoff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
was at no loss for a clew to the
situation. Then the speakers raised
their voices slightly, and the unseen
listener heard every word that was
spoken.</p>

<p>“Inspector Serge Zamosc and
companions,” said the officer, evidently
reading from the passport.
“How does it come that you are
alone?”</p>

<p>“Why, have you not heard?” asked
Zamosc in surprise. “I met with
an unfortunate accident yesterday
about twenty miles back. My horses
got off the post road and broke
through the ice into the Amur
River. I had two Cossacks with me
beside the driver. The latter and
one of the Cossacks were drowned,
and the other soldier was so badly
kicked by the horses that I had to
leave him at the next station back.
I telegraphed on here for a fresh escort.
Did you not get the message?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the officer decidedly.
“I received no message.”</p>

<p>“That is unfortunate,” exclaimed
Zamosc angrily. “The stupid fellow
at the office shall pay dearly for his
negligence. I will see to that later.
But now what am I to do? I am in
haste to reach Vladivostok—for I
intend to return to Russia by water—and
I can’t go on by myself. The
driver whom I brought along tonight
must return in the morning to
the station he came from. Can’t
you spare me two of your Cossacks,
captain?”</p>

<p>“Impossible, your excellency,”
was the quick but courteous reply.
“I am short of men now, or I would
gladly oblige you. At the next
station, however, which is thirty
miles distant, you can readily obtain
Cossacks and a driver. The latter I
could furnish you, but the man I
have in view is really not trustworthy
and I dare not recommend
him.”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t think of taking
him,” said Zamosc. “If the next
station is but thirty miles away I will
drive there alone. I have good
horses, and know how to manage
them. Bear in mind that I am
traveling secretly,” he added in a
lower voice.</p>

<p>“Certainly, your excellency. My
lips shall be sealed.”</p>

<p>This ended the discussion. Zamosc
turned to the <i>starosta</i> and said in a
loud voice, “Bring us food and drink
for two, my worthy man, and see to
it that my sledge is in readiness at
three o’clock in the morning. I wish
to make an early start.”</p>

<p>Sandoff remained in his place of
concealment for fully five minutes,
and then rising slowly up he made a
cautious survey of the room. The
three merchants were spreading rugs
on the floor in preparation for going
to sleep. At the table they had
recently occupied now sat Zamosc
and the Russian officer, hobnobbing
sociably over food and a bottle of
vodka.</p>

<p>Sandoff watched them with a half
smile on his face. “A passport
for himself and companions!” he
whispered. “Traveling on secret
service to Vladivostok! He wants
an escort and a driver!—Well, he
shall have them, if I can provide
them for him. You and I will settle
up old scores, Serge Zamosc. It is a
daring plan—but I will attempt it.”</p>

<p>With this enigmatic self communing
Sandoff turned away. Creeping
noiselessly around the angle of the
house, he passed on to the courtyard
stockade—first making sure that no
one was in sight. What he had
hoped to find was there—a crevice
large enough to see through—and
putting his eyes to it he obtained a
good view of the station yard, and
of Serge Zamosc’s sledge. This
Sandoff examined long and intently.
There was just enough light to reveal
its ample dimensions, the huge
waterproof hood that covered it, and
the mass of furs, rugs, and straw
that peeped out from the rear.</p>

<p>“Good,” muttered Sandoff. “Nothing
could be better suited for the
purpose.”</p>

<p>In the same cautious manner in
which he had come he retraced his
steps to the ravine. Once there he
started off with great strides, and in
ten minutes appeared, breathless and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
excited, before his companions, who
had been on the point of starting to
look for him, alarmed by his long
absence.</p>

<p>“Your hands are empty,” said
Shamarin sadly. “You have brought
no food?”</p>

<p>“I have brought something better
than food,” was the reply. “I bring
good news. If you will bear me out
in the plan I have formed, I can
promise you a quick journey to the
Pacific—a journey in a sledge—food
in plenty, and a warm shelter. There
will be a certain risk, but we won’t
talk of that now.”</p>

<p>Before Shamarin and Vera could
ply him with questions, he told them
what he had just seen and heard.
Then he outlined hurriedly the daring
plan which had entered his
mind.</p>

<p>“All I ask of you,” he concluded,
“is strict obedience, courage, and
constant presence of mind, no matter
what may occur. I know you both
well, and I am convinced that you
have these qualities.”</p>

<p>His companions were at first stunned
with amazement at Sandoff’s
daring proposition, but they soon
realized its practicability.</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” exclaimed Shamarin.
“Truly wonderful! But it
can be carried out—the chances are
all in our favor. I am with you,
Sandoff, body and soul. And what
a glorious way to turn the tables on
that traitorous Zamosc.”</p>

<p>Vera tried to speak, but, woman-like,
broke into tears, and silently
clasped Sandoff’s hand.</p>

<p>Judging from the length of time
that had passed since sunset, it was
now very close to midnight. By
Sandoff’s directions the baggage was
taken off the hand sled, and the latter
was buried deep under the soft snow,
in a hole made by cutting the crust
with the axe. Then the fugitives
struck off at a brisk pace through
the forest. They turned aside before
reaching the post station, and finally,
when the settlement was beyond
sight, they struck boldly out to the
great Siberian road, and followed it
to the eastward. No living or moving
object was in sight. On the left
lay the frozen Amur, and on the
right the sloping foothills. Straight
away before them stretched the
white frozen road marked by a
vanishing line of low telegraph poles.</p>

<p>After walking on for two miles
they came to just such a spot as
Sandoff hoped to find. A rocky
ridge jutted almost to the river, and
the road made a sharp turn around
it. The view was thus cut off in one
direction, while in the other the road
was open and straight for several
miles. Just beyond the rocky spur a
small stream, now ice bound, came
down to the river and passed under
a low wooden bridge. Beneath this
the fugitives discovered a dry, snug
spot among the rocks. Nothing
could have better suited Sandoff’s
plan.</p>

<p>“Wrap yourselves up now and go
to sleep,” he said to his companions.
“I intend to go on guard at once. I
am not weary, and I want time for
thought and reflection. I will give
you early warning when the decisive
moment approaches.”</p>

<p>Shamarin demurred a little, wishing
to share his friend’s vigil, but
soon acquiesced in the latter’s decision,
and he and his sister disappeared
under the bridge. Sandoff
shouldered his rifle and paced rapidly
up and down the strip of road that
led from the bridge to the turning
place at the point of rocks, from
whence he could see without obstruction
far back toward the post station.
The silence was unbroken. Minutes
passed into hours, and hours dragged
by until Sandoff was convinced that
it was past three o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>He had been standing for some
time at the point of rocks, gazing
earnestly to the westward, with a
deadly fear creeping into his heart—a
fear that something had occurred
to spoil the plan on which he and
his companions placed such high
hopes. Suddenly a dim black speck
appeared in the distance. It grew
blacker and larger, and came rapidly
nearer. It was a sledge beyond
doubt, the sledge of Serge Zamosc.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
Now a tinkle of bells was heard,
and a muffled clatter of hoofs.</p>

<p>In haste Sandoff sped back to the
bridge, his heart throbbing with excitement.
A low call brought forth
Shamarin and Vera, still drowsy
with sleep. The keen air soon
sharpened their senses, and they
understood the situation. Sandoff
took Vera in charge and led her
down to the point of rocks.</p>

<p>“There comes the sledge,” he said,
pointing along the frozen road.
“Now get in here and crouch down,”
pointing to a hollow spot among the
rocks. “Your task is simple. When
the sledge has gone past, watch the
road before you, and if anything approaches
give us prompt warning.”</p>

<p>With these instructions he hastened
back to the bridge, where Shamarin
was waiting. The daring men
then took up positions on opposite
sides of the road, crouching behind
masses of frozen snow. Sandoff
had the rifle, Shamarin the pistol,
and both weapons were loaded.</p>

<p>“There must be no failure,” said
Sandoff grimly.</p>

<p>“There <i>will</i> be no failure,” echoed
Shamarin from across the way.</p>

<p>Then all was silent—except for the
musical tinkle of bells and crunching
of hoofs on the snow. Five
minutes later—it may have been less
and it may have been more—the
sledge whizzed into view from
around the point of rocks. The three
horses, harnessed abreast, were galloping
at full speed, and the only occupant
of the sledge was Serge
Zamosc, muffled to the nose in furs
and holding the lines with a practiced
hand.</p>

<p>On and on it came until the planking
of the bridge was less than half
a dozen yards away. The moment
had come. Sandoff and Shamarin
sprang up, reaching the center of the
road at a bound, and turned their
weapons straight into Serge Zamosc’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“Stop, or we fire,” they cried
loudly.</p>

<p>Zamosc, for all his treacherous
traits, was no coward. His first impulse
was to check his horses, and
he acted upon it—partly. Then he
turned to grasp his gun, but finding
it out of reach, he struck his horses
a terrific blow with the whip and
rolled backward from his seat into
the body of the sledge.</p>

<p>The frightened steeds plunged
forward, but Shamarin was on the
alert, and clutched at the lines. He
caught them, was dragged along for
a few yards, still holding tight, and
then, gaining a foothold, he turned
the tide and brought the triple team
to a standstill on the very edge of
the bridge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sandoff had bounded
into the sledge, and was struggling
over the straw, interlocked with
Zamosc, who fought with the fury of
a madman, believing that he had
fallen into the hands of the Siberian
assassins who frequently ply their
calling along the post road. But he
was no match for Sandoff—weakened
as the latter was by privation—and
soon he was helpless in the
grasp of the convict. The horses
were by this time quite subdued,
and having no fear of a runaway
Shamarin left them and ran back to
help his companion. There was
plenty of strong rope in the sledge,
and Zamosc was soon tightly bound,
hand and foot. Then his captors
placed him in one corner, and proceeded
to examine the interior of the
sledge. It contained a small iron
chest, two trunks, a hamper of provisions,
two rifles with ammunition,
and nine splendid fur robes.</p>

<p>Sandoff opened one of the trunks.
It held clothes—just what they
wanted most. He and Shamarin
quickly took off their prison garments,
and substituted suits of dark
material. The coats fitted fairly
well, but the trousers were lamentably
short—a defect which their
high boots partially remedied. This
exchange was made by the side of
the road, out of Zamosc’s sight.
Then Sandoff put on the huge fur
cloak, which they had taken from
Zamosc before binding him, and
handed the Cossack coat and cap to
his comrade, who found them a good
fit. Shamarin took the discarded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
garments, wrapped them about a big
stone, and dropped them into a black
air hole in the Amur, a short distance
from the bank.</p>

<p>Up to this time Zamosc had been
perfectly quiet, but now he gave
voice to a loud cry. Sandoff entered
the sledge and gagged him with a
handkerchief, performing the operation
with as little discomfort as
possible to his prisoner, but with
such skill that any outcry was out of
the question.</p>

<p>“I will have my interview with the
fellow later,” he said to Shamarin.
“As yet he does not recognize us.
The first thing is to get away from
this locality.”</p>

<p>A short whistle brought Vera from
her post. She was overjoyed at the
success of Sandoff’s plan, and reported
the road to the westward clear.
Five minutes was spent in covering
Zamosc up among the rugs in one
end of the sledge, and Vera in the
other. Then the hood was dropped
over the rear end and buttoned
down, and Sandoff mounted to the
seat, drawing the collar of his fur
coat high about his ears, and thrusting
his hand into the inner pocket
to make sure that Zamosc’s little
packet of valuable documents was
safe. Shamarin mounted beside
him, looking every inch a Cossack
with his green uniform, his rifle, and
his black, matted beard.</p>

<p>“Remember,” said Sandoff warningly,
as he gathered the lines together
and flicked the spirited horses
with the whip, “remember that from
this time on I am Inspector Zamosc!”</p>

<p>Then the sledge bounded forward,
rumbled across the bridge, and sped
over the frozen road, toward the
Pacific, Vladivostok—and freedom.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
COLONEL NORD OF RIGA.</h3>

<p class="dcap">The gray dawn stole over the
sky, and when it was sufficiently
light for his purpose Sandoff
drew out the bundle of papers and
examined them closely. One was
the passport, made out in the name
of Serge Zamosc and companions—a
form which admitted of a very wide
construction. The others were letters
of instruction, which made clear—at
least to a certain point—the object
of Zamosc’s journey across Siberia.
It appeared that the inspector
was to report on the condition of
Siberian prisons, with a view to
changes which the Minister of Police
had in contemplation. Moreover the
nature of these letters showed that
Zamosc’s mission was a secret one,
and among them was one document
which enjoined all government officials
along the route to give him
whatever aid he might require.</p>

<p>“I rely on this more than anything,”
said Sandoff to his companion,
“for it puts us beyond the reach
of unpleasant questioning. As for
Vera, I have a plan that promises
well. I will say that she is the wife
of some Russian officer at Irkutsk,
who is going to visit friends at Vladivostok,
and whom I have agreed to
see to her destination.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is a splendid plan,” rejoined
Shamarin. “But yourself,
are you in no danger?”</p>

<p>“Very little, I think,” said Sandoff
confidently. “It is not likely that
we shall encounter any one who ever
saw Zamosc, for he was never out of
Russia before. We will travel rapidly
and make as few stops as possible.
We will part company with our
captive as soon as Vladivostok is
reached.”</p>

<p>“And what will you do with him in
the meantime?” asked Shamarin.
“Would it not be best to put him out
of the way?”</p>

<p>“By no means,” answered Sandoff
decidedly. “I don’t propose to commit
murder. We will keep him constantly
gagged and bound, and at
night—whenever we happen to be
stopping at a post station—you,
Shamarin, will have to sleep in the
sledge with him. We will keep him
well covered up, and with care none
but ourselves will ever see him.”</p>

<p>Shamarin was satisfied with this
plan, and promised to perform his
part faithfully. It was now fully
light, and on reaching a lonely spot
along the road Sandoff turned the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
horses aside into the forest. The
hood was lifted from the end of the
sledge, and while Vera was taking
the provisions out of the hamper,
Sandoff placed the captive in an upright
position and removed the gag
from his mouth. The early rays of
the sun were now shining into the
sledge. As Zamosc surveyed the
faces of his companions his eyes
gleamed with sudden recognition.</p>

<p>“I know you,” he muttered savagely.
“I thought you were all drowned—they
told me so at the mines.
You will pay dearly for this outrage.
You know full well that you can
never escape.”</p>

<p>Sandoff turned to him with such ill
repressed fury that the traitor’s face
grew livid with fear.</p>

<p>“I am glad that you know me, you
black hearted scoundrel,” he cried
hoarsely. “If I gave you your deserts
I should put an end to your
life, as I at first intended. But I have
changed my mind, and shall be satisfied
to make you the instrument of
our escape. I don’t intend to part
company with you, Zamosc, until we
have reached the Pacific, and I warn
you now that if at any time you attempt
to escape or to endanger us, I
will kill you as I would a dog.”</p>

<p>Zamosc made no reply, but a
strange look of exultation shone
about his little eyes that quite escaped
the notice of Sandoff and his
companions. A short time later,
after gagging the captive and placing
him in his nest of rugs, Sandoff
took the lines and drove the sledge
back to the post road.</p>

<p>During the next two weeks the fugitives
traveled rapidly, obtaining relays
of horses whenever needed. They
met plenty of travelers coming from
the opposite direction—merchants,
squads of Cossacks, and Russian officers
journeying from one post to
the other, but Sandoff’s distinguished
bearing and appearance, and the
presence of Shamarin by his side in
Cossack uniform, precluded all possibility
of detention or suspicion.
Vera and Zamosc were at all times
out of sight, the covering of the
sledge being kept closely down.
Sometimes they bivouacked along
the road, building fires for comfort
and protection from wild animals.
Whenever they chanced to spend a
night at a post station all passed off
well. The <i>starosta’s</i> wife usually took
charge of Vera, who was now known
as Madame Gunsburg, and Shamarin
kept a close watch over Zamosc,
both sleeping in the sledge in the
courtyard.</p>

<p>The latter bore his enforced captivity
well in spite of the fact that he
was constantly bound and gagged—except
when food was given him.
He stoutly refused to answer any
questions, however—especially in regard
to the key of the small iron
chest found in the sledge. The key
was certainly not on Zamosc’s person,
and a thorough search of the
sledge failed to reveal it.</p>

<p>During the first week of their
sledge journey the fugitives covered
nearly four hundred miles. But
after they left the valley of the Amur
and turned southward along the
valley of the Ussuri River, the
weather changed suddenly—an unusual
event at this time of year, for
it was but the middle of March—and
a thaw began, which speedily turned
the post road into a bed of slush and
water. This lasted for two whole
weeks, making rapid traveling out of
the question. At the end of that
period Sandoff and his companions
found they had covered but one
hundred and fifty miles, and were
still an equal distance from Vladivostok.
They now rarely met
travelers, for it was the season of the
year when journeying by sledge or
wagon is equally impossible, and
from present indications it would
take them three weeks or a month to
cover the brief distance remaining.</p>

<p>But on the last night of March a
cheering change came. They were
stopping at a post station on the
Ussuri, and when Sandoff rose early,
as was his wont, and went out into
the courtyard to see how Shamarin
and Zamosc had fared, he found the
air bitterly cold, and the river,
which had partly broken up on the
previous day, ice bound from bank<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
to bank. The post road, as far as
the eye could reach, was smooth,
hard and glassy.</p>

<p>No time was lost in starting, and
as the fresh relay of horses bounded
forward under loose rein, with
the sledge trailing lightly behind
them, Sandoff turned to his companions
and cried exultantly:
“Hurra! We are safe! This cold
spell won’t last long, but it will be
quite sufficient to carry us to Vladivostok—or
nearly there, for I have
no intention of entering the town.
We will make no more stops but
push right on, and by tomorrow
night we ought to reach our journey’s
end.”</p>

<p>At noon a village of some size was
reached, Riga by name, and here the
passports of the travelers were demanded
by a bearded Russian officer
who stopped the sledge before the
military post in the center of the
town.</p>

<p>He glanced over the document
with sudden interest, whispering to
several companions standing near,
and then handed it back to Sandoff.</p>

<p>“If your excellency wishes a good
hotel,” he said, “I can direct you to
one—or perhaps you would prefer
the hospitality of the barracks? The
best we have is at your service. Our
commander, Colonel Nord, is absent,
but will return before evening.”</p>

<p>Sandoff looked doubtfully at the
speaker, with a dim suspicion that
something was wrong.</p>

<p>“Give my best regards to Colonel
Nord,” he said calmly. “Tell him
that I am in haste, and must go on
to the next station.”</p>

<p>The officer was plainly taken aback
by this answer. He looked at Sandoff,
and then at his companions,
who were no less surprised. From
his nest of rugs, deep down in the
sledge, Zamosc uttered a faint
chuckle that no one heard. Sandoff
bowed with dignity to the officer,
calmly gathered up the lines, and
called to the horses. The sledge
moved slowly off, gaining speed with
each second, but the sharp command
to stop that Sandoff more than half
feared did not come.</p>

<p>Vera was on her knees, peeping
through a hole in the rear curtain.</p>

<p>“The officer is still standing in the
center of the road,” she announced
eagerly. “He is talking to his companions,
and pointing. Now the
Cossacks are coming out of the
military post—a dozen of them.
People are running from their houses
to see what is the matter.”</p>

<p>An interval of silence and suspense,
during which the sledge moved
rapidly down the street.</p>

<p>“Now the officer has gone back,”
continued Vera in a tone of relief,
“and the Cossacks are moving away
too. Only a few peasants are in
sight.”</p>

<p>A moment later the sledge passed
into a hollow that concealed the town
from view, and when it reached the
crest of the next ridge a single Cossack
could be seen standing before
the military post. As the village receded
in the distance the fugitives
began to feel more easy.</p>

<p>“I was greatly alarmed for a few
seconds,” admitted Sandoff. “The
officer evidently expected us to stop,
though I have no idea why. It is
possible that trouble will come out
of this affair yet. If I thought so I
would suggest that we abandon the
sledge and take to the forest with
the horses.”</p>

<p>“Try <i>him</i>,” suggested Shamarin
with a backward jerk of his arm.
“He’ll know all about it.”</p>

<p>Sandoff was favorably impressed
with this idea. Handing the lines to
his companion, he dropped into the
sledge, hauled Zamosc out of the
rugs, and took the gag from his
mouth.</p>

<p>“You heard our conversation at
Riga a few moments ago,” he said
sternly. “Don’t try to deny it,” for
Zamosc had suddenly assumed an
expression of guileless amazement.</p>

<p>“And suppose I did hear it,” he
retorted defiantly, “what then?”</p>

<p>“Simply this,” replied Sandoff. “I
wish to know, and I intend to know,
what it means. It will be to your
interest to answer me, for if I find
hereafter that we are in danger of
recapture I will shoot you without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
mercy, whereas if we get safely to
the coast you will be liberated.”</p>

<p>This plain statement seemed to
have an effect on Zamosc.</p>

<p>“Since you take advantage of my
helplessness I will tell you,” he said
reluctantly. “For more than a year
past Colonel Nord, the military commandant
at Riga, has been beseeching
the authorities at St. Petersburg
for a new barracks, and shortly before
I began my journey he was
notified that I was coming and that
I would make an inspection of the
building and report on its condition.
I hope you are satisfied now.”</p>

<p>He bore Sandoff’s keen glance
without flinching. Either he was
telling the truth, or he was an adept
in the art of lying.</p>

<p>“That certainly seems plausible,”
said Sandoff, as he regagged the
captive and put him back among the
rugs. “Circumstances seem to bear
out his story. When I get to the
next station I will telegraph back to
Colonel Nord that I was compelled
to—no, I won’t either. I’ll let matters
go as they are. The colonel will
be furious with rage, and will open
communication with St. Petersburg
at once, but by the time he gets any
definite answer we shall be out of
reach.”</p>

<p>Faster and faster sped the sledge.
Mountains and hills, forests and
ravines loomed up ahead, shot swiftly
by, and faded into the distance.
At last far off on the plain a speck
appeared, and soon the speck was
transformed into a tiny Siberian
village—a post house, a military
station, a telegraph office, and a few
lonely cabins—not more than five or
six.</p>

<p>The sun was just sinking into a
crimson bed of clouds when the
faithful horses entered the little
street on a gallop. An instant later
they were pulled back on their
haunches with foaming nostrils and
steaming flanks, as a gate swung
suddenly across the road checking
further progress. It was directly in
front of the little box-like military
post that this occurred, and as Sandoff
broke into an angry exclamation
at the audacity of the deed, an officer
came out into the road.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by this?”
cried Sandoff angrily.</p>

<p>The man bowed almost to the
ground. “Pardon, a thousand pardons,
your excellency!” he entreated.
“There was no other way—you
were going so fast. The noise of the
bells would have prevented you from
hearing my voice.”</p>

<p>“And now what do you want—my
passport?” demanded Sandoff roughly.</p>

<p>“No! No! Your excellency, I beg
you not. It is a matter of a different
nature. You are the honorable Inspector
Serge Zamosc—I am not mistaken
on that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am he. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, your excellency, I have a
telegram from Colonel Nord at Riga.
He wishes you to remain here until
he comes. He has already started.”</p>

<p>“The devil you have!” exclaimed
Sandoff blankly. “Well, my good
fellow, I am sorry I can’t oblige the
colonel. I am in haste to get to
Vladivostok, and I really can’t afford
to lose so much as an hour. Tell the
colonel that a man will come on from
Vladivostok in a day or so to look
into that little matter of the barracks.”</p>

<p>“I—I am sorry, your excellency,”
stammered the officer, “but Colonel
Nord will take no denial. He insists
that you wait here, and I dare not
allow you to proceed.”</p>

<p>It was clear that Inspector Serge
Zamosc might be a great man at
home in Russia, but here in Eastern
Siberia Colonel Nord was a greater.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sandoff, as he realized
the situation and choked down his
anger, “I suppose you are only doing
your duty. Since Colonel Nord
is so importunate I will await his
arrival. How soon do you think
that will be?”</p>

<p>“In two hours at the most,” replied
the officer, “probably less.
Until then let me offer you the use of
my guard house.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Sandoff
shortly, “I will go to the post station
and get supper and order a relay of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
fresh horses. Colonel Nord will find
me there.”</p>

<p>He slowly turned the sledge
around and drove into the court yard
of the station, which was but a few
yards away. The <i>starosta</i> came out
to meet the new arrival, rubbing his
hands in gleeful anticipation of
legitimate robbery.</p>

<p>“You will remain over night, your
honor?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sandoff, “but I want a
fresh relay of horses and some refreshment.
Attend to these tired
beasts first, and when supper is ready
let us know. Meanwhile we will remain
here.”</p>

<p>The <i>starosta’s</i> cheerful expression
faded away, but without more words
he unharnessed the horses and led
them off to the stable. Sandoff
climbed to the ground, followed by
Shamarin, and the latter assisted
Vera to dismount.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sandoff, “what do
you think of the situation?”</p>

<p>“Unfavorable!” replied Shamarin.</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you,” exclaimed
Vera quickly. “It is vexatious—that
is all. If this obstinate Colonel
Nord will not be pacified, Victor”—these
two had long since dropped
all formality of speech—“we’ll have
to return to Riga and inspect his
barracks—that is, if the colonel’s
visit relates to this matter.”</p>

<p>She spoke in a peculiar tone that
piqued Sandoff’s curiosity.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>Vera placed her finger to her lips,
and glanced toward the sledge.</p>

<p>“I will talk to you later on,” she
whispered.</p>

<p>Shamarin did not observe this little
bit of byplay. His eyes had
been fixed on the ground, and now
he looked up and said uneasily, “It
would be better to escape if possible.
One can’t predict what may come of
this visit.”</p>

<p>“I rather agree with you,” replied
Sandoff. He walked to the courtyard
gate, looked out for a moment,
and then came slowly back.</p>

<p>“Escape is impossible,” he said.
“Two Cossacks are standing at the
western end of the street, and the
gate before the military post is still
closed and guarded.”</p>

<p>The <i>starosta</i> now appeared with
the news that supper was waiting,
so Sandoff and Vera entered the
house, leaving Shamarin with the
sledge, and promising to send him
out some food.</p>

<p>Vera and her companion felt little
desire to eat as they sat down at opposite
sides of the table. The post
room was quite empty, and they
could talk without being overheard.</p>

<p>“Vera, what do you wish to tell
me?” asked Sandoff, as he poured a
cup of tea from the samovar.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she replied. “At
least, nothing definite. I have only
a vague suspicion.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“Of the contents of that iron
chest. I believe that Serge Zamosc
invented the story he told us about
Colonel Nord, and I believe that the
chest, if opened, would enlighten us
somewhat. I can’t tell you why I
think so, unless it is because Zamosc
has been smiling to himself all day
long and turning his eyes in the
direction of the chest, when he
thought he was unobserved.”</p>

<p>Sandoff did not reply for a moment.
He ate a few mouthfuls of
food, and then rose from the table.</p>

<p>“Your suggestion is worth acting
upon,” he said. “I intend to get
that chest open—by force if necessary,
though I will make another
short search for the key.”</p>

<p>They passed out into the courtyard,
the gate of which was already closed
for the night. Sandoff climbed into the
sledge—to Shamarin’s surprise—and
hauling Zamosc to an upright position
began a thorough search of his
clothing. It proved unsuccessful,
and Sandoff was about to desist when
a sudden inspiration struck him.
Dropping Zamosc on his back he
drew off his right boot. When Sandoff
shook it something rattled, and
placing his hand inside he drew out
a small iron key.</p>

<p>“At last!” he exclaimed. “Why
did I not think of that before?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“Hold on,” said Shamarin. “I will
tell the <i>starosta</i> that we have lost
something in the straw, and will borrow
a lighted lantern from him.”</p>

<p>He went off in haste, and meanwhile
Sandoff put his captive back
among the rugs and covered him up
completely.</p>

<p>Shamarin returned in a moment,
bringing the lantern, and handed it
to Sandoff. The latter drew the
side and rear curtains of the sledge
tightly down and placed the lantern
on one of the trunks, while Vera
dragged the iron chest from its place
of concealment in the straw.</p>

<p>The key fitted the lock, and with
a trembling hand Sandoff raised the
lid.</p>

<p>A simultaneous cry of amazement
issued from his and Vera’s lips. The
chest was more than half full of bank
notes and stacks of gold coin. On
the top of them lay a folded paper.
Sandoff was as pale as ashes as he
lifted this and glanced at its contents.</p>

<p>“That scoundrel Zamosc has deceived
us,” he cried hoarsely. “But
for you, Vera, we should be lost.
This paper explains it all. The
government took advantage of Serge
Zamosc’s journey of prison inspection
to appoint him paymaster and
send him on to Vladivostok with the
annual salaries of the East Siberian
officials. Here is the list of names.
It commences with Colonel Nord, at
Riga, 5,000 rubles, and, with the
exception of two points along the
way, the others are in Vladivostok.
No wonder that the colonel is anxious
to see me. He must have been apprised
of Zamosc’s visit beforehand.
When he arrives I will pay him the
money, make suitable apologies, and
then we will resume our journey.
Help me to carry this money into the
post room. That will be the proper
place for the interview with the
colonel.”</p>

<p>The two men conveyed the chest
into the house between them, groaning
not a little under its ponderous
weight, and then, leaving Vera to
take charge of it, Shamarin returned
to the sledge, while Sandoff hunted
up the <i>starosta</i> and ordered glasses
and a bottle of wine to be taken into
the post room.</p>

<p>“I expect a visitor in a short
time,” he said, “and as I may be delayed
with him longer than I expect I
want you to put fresh horses into my
sledge at once. What do I owe you
for your services?”</p>

<p>The <i>starosta</i> named an exorbitant
figure, but Sandoff paid it without
demur, and then waited in the courtyard
until the three spirited horses
were harnessed.</p>

<p>He now went back into the post
room, and sent Vera out to the
sledge, with instructions to draw the
covering tightly and remain inside.
Then he paced up and down the
room for probably half an hour,
glancing through the window from
time to time into the courtyard.</p>

<p>All at once a ringing clatter of
hoofs was heard that came nearer
with every second, and a moment
later the sound of voices and a loud
call for the <i>starosta</i> apprised Sandoff
that the horsemen had entered the
yard. He glanced cautiously
through the window, and could
dimly make out five mounted figures—Colonel
Nord and his escort, beyond
a doubt.</p>

<p>Leaving the window after the first
hasty glance, Sandoff threw up the
lid of the chest, placed the paper on
the table before him, lit a cigar, and
seated himself comfortably in a chair.
He had hardly done so when the
door was thrown open, and the
<i>starosta</i> entered, followed by a large
red faced man in full uniform.</p>

<p>“Colonel Nord, your excellency,”
he stammered, backing out of the
room and closing the door.</p>

<p>The colonel was unmistakably surprised
at sight of Sandoff. He
hesitated a moment, and then, catching
sight of the chest of money,
bowed in a formal manner.</p>

<p>Sandoff held out his hand.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Colonel
Nord. I owe you an apology for my
seemingly strange conduct this
morning, and beg you will accept my
explanation——”</p>

<p>The colonel’s brow grew dark, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
he glared at Sandoff under his bushy
eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Sir, I wish to see Inspector
Zamosc,” he thundered. “<i>You are
not the man!</i>”</p>

<p>For an instant Sandoff could only
stare at his visitor in hopeless confusion.
Here was a contingency that
had never entered his head.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” continued
the colonel fiercely. “Is the inspector
afraid to meet me in person?
Does he forget having made my
acquaintance in Petersburg last
summer, that he attempts to palm off
a substitute upon me? I refuse to
treat with you. I will not touch a
cent of that money, unless Inspector
Zamosc counts it out with his own
hand. Where is he? I demand to
see him.”</p>

<p>The irate colonel started for the
door, and would have rushed out to
the sledge had not Sandoff checked
him in time.</p>

<p>“Stop just a moment, Colonel
Nord, and hear my explanation,” he
entreated. “It is true that I am not
Inspector Zamosc—I am merely his
assistant. It was through a sad
error that the inspector drove
through Riga this morning without
stopping. He has now begged me
to see you in his stead and plead
sickness as an excuse for his absence.
He is out in the sledge, but
if you insist upon seeing him I will
summon him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do insist upon seeing him,”
the colonel replied with a grim smile.
“There are various private matters
that must be discussed. Tell the
inspector that he needn’t be afraid
of me,” he added with a short
chuckle.</p>

<p>“I will deliver your message,” replied
Sandoff calmly. “Kindly excuse
me while I go to summon the
inspector. You will find cigars and
wine on the table.”</p>

<p>“I had better accompany you,”
said Colonel Nord jocosely. “The
inspector might take fright and run
away. When he sees that I am not
in a violent rage he will be reassured.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he preceded his companion
to the door. For a moment
Sandoff thought all was lost, but a
idea occurred to him just in time.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, colonel!” he exclaimed.
“But all that money—would
it be safe to leave it here
alone?”</p>

<p>“Ah, no, quite right!” muttered
the colonel, glancing greedily at the
chest. “I will remain here. Be
quick, though, for I must return to
Riga as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Sandoff left the room with a firm
step and composed bearing, but
nevertheless his brain was fairly
bursting with the intensity of his
thoughts. He had but one idea—the
necessity of making an immediate
and desperate dash for liberty.</p>

<p>The game was up. Just inside
the door stood the four Cossacks
who formed Colonel Nord’s escort.
They were laughing and talking
boisterously, and Sandoff noted with
satisfaction that the <i>starosta</i> had taken
away their horses—probably to be
fed and watered. Here was one
danger out of the way. The sledge
stood where he had left it, facing the
road, and the gates were wide open,
the <i>starosta</i> having neglected to close
them after Colonel Nord’s entry.
Another favorable circumstance!</p>

<p>Sandoff calmly untied the strap
that held the horses to the gate post.
Then he turned and slowly mounted
the seat beside Shamarin. Even in
the dim light the marble pallor of his
face was visible, and his companions
were quick to scent danger.</p>

<p>“Something has happened,” said
Vera. “What is it, Victor?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Sandoff in a voice
that they hardly recognized. “Not
so loud! All is lost and discovery is
inevitable. Prepare the firearms for
use. All depends now on getting
clear of the village.”</p>

<p>He gathered up the lines and
Shamarin touched the horses with
the whip. They trotted out of the
yard, the circlet of bells making
merry music over their heads, and
turned up the street on a gallop.</p>

<p>“Those accursed bells!” muttered
Sandoff. “Why did I not take them
off?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>Then he fiercely jerked the horses
to a standstill as the military post
loomed in view, with the barred gate
stretching from side to side across
the road.</p>

<p>The officer who had stopped them
before came out with a lantern.</p>

<p>“Open the gate,” demanded Sandoff.
“I am in haste, and must make
up for lost time.”</p>

<p>The man hesitated. “Have you
seen Colonel Nord already, your excellency?
He came but a moment
or two ago.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, you blockhead!” roared
Sandoff, losing control of himself.
“Else why should I be here? Open
that gate instantly!”</p>

<p>The officer was cowed by this determined
attitude, and moved forward
with the evident intention of
obeying; but before he could take
three steps a door was heard to slam
violently, and from the post yard
came a volley of shouts and curses,
delivered in Colonel Nord’s high
pitched voice. Then followed answering
cries, and a quick running
of feet over the frozen snow.</p>

<p>The officer halted, and looked
keenly at the occupants of the sledge.
Then he called “Guard! guard!”
in a shrill voice.</p>

<p>“Hold firm,” whispered Shamarin.
“There’s only one way—I’ll do it—stand
by me.”</p>

<p>With a leap he was on the ground,
and running toward the gate, where
stood a single Cossack. As he passed
the officer the latter whipped out his
sword, and started in pursuit. Sandoff
caught the gleam of steel, and,
leaning from the seat, whip in hand,
he dealt the fellow so terrific a blow
on the arm that he dropped the
weapon and howled with pain.
Shamarin reached the gate and was
confronted by the burly soldier before
it, rifle in hand. There was no time
for parleying. Shamarin dodged
under the Cossack’s rifle and flung
the fellow to one side of the road,
where he lay stunned in the snow and
ice. Then he dashed furiously at
the gate—which was fortunately not
locked—and by a single blow knocked
it half way back on its hinges.</p>

<p>It was now Sandoff’s turn. Swinging
his whip overhead, he brought it
down smartly on the horses. The
spirited brutes plunged madly forward,
and he urged them with hoarse
shouts to still greater speed. As
they dashed through the gateway,
Shamarin regained his seat by a flying
leap.</p>

<p>The whole affair had consumed
but a few seconds. Before the Cossacks
could realize the audacity of
the deed, the sledge and its occupants
were whizzing away into the
night at a rate of speed that had seldom
been equaled on the great
Siberian road.</p>

<p>The officer picked up his sword
with his uninjured arm, and swore
and yelled alternately until he was
hoarse. The vanquished Cossack
rose to his feet, and idiotically jerked
the gate shut with a bang. The
others ran for their horses and
mounted in hot haste—and in the
midst of all the confusion up clattered
Colonel Nord and his escort,
bawling at the top of their voices.</p>

<p>“Idiot! Blockhead!” the colonel
roared at the terrified officer. “You
will pay dearly for this! Why did
you let those scoundrels through?
Open that gate at once—send after
me all the men you have—telegraph
to the next station. Do you hear
me?”</p>

<p>Then, as the gate swung back, the
irate colonel and his squad of armed
Cossacks—now increased to nine—galloped
madly through, and went
pounding along the frosty road in
hot chase of the fugitive sledge.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br>
MAURICE DUPONT.</h3>

<p class="dcap">As the twinkling lights of the
little settlement receded in the
distance, and the stretch of road intervening
still remained free from
pursuers, Sandoff and his companions
felt their spirits rise, darkly as
the future loomed ahead. Shamarin
helped Vera to prepare and
load all the guns. This done, he
furled the rear hood, and stationed
himself so that he could see back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
along the course over which they
had come. The horses continued to
gallop at a tremendous pace, but
when two or three miles had been
traversed the pursuers hove in sight,
and Shamarin soon reported the
alarming fact that they were gaining.</p>

<p>“They will continue to gain, of
course,” said Sandoff. “It can’t be
otherwise. We must fight them off.”</p>

<p>He backed the two trunks and a
pile of rugs against the seat, for
protection to himself while driving,
and instructed Vera and Shamarin
to keep low in the bottom of the
sledge, which had a depth of at least
two feet.</p>

<p>By this time the Cossacks were
close enough to be counted, and
close enough for something else, too,
for a shower of bullets suddenly
whistled about the sledge. Shamarin
retorted with two cleverly aimed
shots, and disabled one of the enemy.
This occasioned a slight delay, after
which the Cossacks came on more
rapidly than ever. It was evident
that a resumption of firing would
do speedy harm to the fugitives or
their horses. Taking advantage of
a smooth bit of road where the
sledge made little noise, Shamarin
leaned from the end and shouted
with all his might:</p>

<p>“We have a captive here—Inspector
Zamosc. We are going to place
him in range, and if you shoot again
you will surely kill him.”</p>

<p>Colonel Nord’s reply to this was a
volley of oaths, but the firing was not
resumed, in spite of the fact that occasional
shots from the sledge held
the Cossacks at bay.</p>

<p>None realized the critical nature
of the situation better than Sandoff.
Nearly half the distance to the next
station had been covered, and at any
moment Cossacks might be met
coming from the opposite direction.
He decided on a daring and
uncertain plan—nothing less than to
abandon the post road and strike
across country toward the coast.
Although Vladivostok was yet some
sixty miles away, it was barely two
thirds of that distance to the nearest
point on the Sea of Japan.</p>

<p>The desired opportunity speedily
came—none too soon, however, for
the Cossacks were beginning to
spread out with a view of getting
ahead of the sledge or of shooting
down the horses.</p>

<p>To the right of the post road lay
wooded hills, and on the left, toward
the sea coast, was a stretch of undulating
country very little timbered.
Sandoff abruptly turned the horses
in this direction, and applied the
whip with merciless severity. The
sledge attained a speed that was
truly terrific. It skimmed over the
frozen ground, swaying dizzily from
side to side, and leaping high in air
as it struck hillocks or scattered
stones.</p>

<p>The Cossacks made a desperate
effort to overtake the fugitives, but
the four who had come on from Riga
with Colonel Nord began to fall behind,
their horses being exhausted.
The colonel himself had evidently
procured a fresh steed at the post
station, for he pushed on with the
other three Cossacks.</p>

<p>For half an hour this wild race
continued. The ground increased
in ruggedness. The undulating
swells of land grew higher, and the
hollows between them consequently
deeper. As the horses galloped with
steaming nostrils up one of these
long slopes and dragged the sledge
lightly over the crest, Sandoff uttered
a cry of dismay. Down in the next
valley wound a stream a hundred
yards or more in width. It was ice
bound, but the glassy covering looked
smooth and treacherous, and was
dotted with air holes.</p>

<p>“They have us now!” exclaimed
Shamarin. “The game’s up!”</p>

<p>Sandoff gritted his teeth and took
a firmer hold of the lines.</p>

<p>“There is a chance yet,” he cried
hoarsely to his companions. “Drowning
is better than recapture.” Then
he lashed the horses more furiously
than ever, and the sledge went down
the frozen descent like a meteor, and
whizzed out on the sheet of ice. Had
the horses been moving less rapidly
they must have broken through at
once, but their very speed carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
them on over the treacherous surface.
The frail ice behind the sledge
creaked and groaned and broke, and
the angry and amazed Cossacks,
who were close in pursuit, found their
progress cut off by a watery gulf.</p>

<p>On went the sledge, Sandoff all
the while urging the noble beasts by
whip and voice, but when the shore
was only half a dozen yards away
the ice gave way with a terrific
crash.</p>

<p>Sandoff plunged into the icy water
waist deep, and, taking Vera in his
arms, conveyed her in safety to the
bank. Shamarin followed him with
an armful of rifles and ammunition.
Then Sandoff returned to the horses,
knife in hand, and regardless of the
bullets that pattered about him, he
severed two of the animals from their
fastenings, and after much kicking
and plunging they gained a foothold
on the firm ice. The third horse was
struck in the head by a bullet, just as
Shamarin—who had hurried back to
aid his companion—was cutting it
loose, and with a shrill neigh it
rolled over into the water.</p>

<p>“Mount as once,” cried Sandoff,
as he led the horses out on the shore.
“Vera can ride with you or me—it
matters not which.”</p>

<p>“And Zamosc! Shall I shoot him
before I go?”</p>

<p>“No, leave him to his fate.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Vera, placing her
hand softly on Sandoff’s arm, “the
sledge is sinking, and he is helpless.
Give him a chance for his life.”</p>

<p>“The villain doesn’t deserve it,”
replied Sandoff shortly, but meeting
an appealing glance from Vera’s eyes
he turned and waded back to the
sledge. Leaning over the seat he
pulled Zamosc to an upright position,
and took the gag from his mouth.</p>

<p>“If you value your life you had
better tell your friends to cease firing,”
he said.</p>

<p>Zamosc lost no time in making
good use of his voice, and he was
shouting lustily for help when Sandoff
regained the shore. By the aid
of a huge bowlder Shamarin mounted
one of the horses. As it happened
to be the smaller of the two,
Sandoff mounted the other, and
helped Vera up behind him. A
moment later the fugitives vanished
over the crest of the next ridge.</p>

<p>A succession of thick forests and
rockstrewn ravines made progress
slow and painful. Day came, revealing
a barren and desolate country
stretching as far as the eye could
reach. In front of the fugitives
towered a range of lofty mountains.
After three or four hours of difficult
riding they reached the foothills,
themselves and their horses thoroughly
exhausted. Here the latter
were abandoned, and the ascent was
begun on foot. A long and wearisome
climb brought the refugees to
the top, and here their eyes were
gladdened by the sight they had
longed to see. The mountain and
the wooded hills at its base sloped
gently to the eastward for half a
dozen miles, and beyond were the
fair blue waters of the Japan Sea,
fading away into the horizon. Near
the shore lay two black objects—steamers
without doubt.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when
the fugitives drew near the sea. One
slight ridge crowned with pine trees
lay between them and the desired
goal. They crept through the valley
with slow and cautious steps,
fearing either to meet Cossacks who
had come up the coast from Vladivostok,
apprised of the situation by
telegraph, or to be overtaken by
Colonel Nord and his party, who for
all they knew might have been following
them since the previous night.</p>

<p>“The first thing is to get a good
look at those vessels lying off the
shore and discover their nationality,”
said Sandoff.</p>

<p>At that moment a rifle shot rang
sharply on the air, and was followed
by a second report and a ferocious
yell that came from no human
throat.</p>

<p>“Some wild beast!” muttered
Sandoff, and as he spoke a man’s
voice cried, “Help! Help!”</p>

<p>The tragedy—for such it seemed
to be—was taking place but a few
yards distant.</p>

<p>Rifle in hand, Sandoff ran forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
for a dozen yards or more and peered
through the thick foliage into a
circular open glade. In the center
of this rose a rounded bowlder six
or eight feet high, and perched on
the top was a young man, striking
blow after blow with a clubbed rifle
at a great wounded tiger cat who
was making frantic efforts to get at
him.</p>

<p>At sight of the stranger Sandoff
uttered a cry of surprise. “Can it
be he?” he said aloud. “Yes, it
surely is. What can he be doing——”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, for
at that instant the tiger cat sprang
fairly to the top of the bowlder,
and seized the unfortunate man by
the ankle. It was no time for hesitation.
Sandoff boldly advanced
from the bushes, and, taking aim at
the tiger cat’s head, fired. The brute
rolled backward in his death struggle,
while the rescued man half fell, half
jumped, from the rock, and limped
toward Sandoff with amazement
and gratitude visible on his face.</p>

<p>“I owe you my life,” he said
huskily. “That was a good shot of
yours. I fired twice at the brute,
but failed to kill him, and my steward,
who was with me, ran off.
The coward won’t stop now until he
gets to the yacht.”</p>

<p>“The yacht!” cried Sandoff
hoarsely. “Is your yacht here? But
don’t you know me, Maurice Dupont?—No,
of course you don’t. I am
Victor Sandoff.”</p>

<p>“Victor Sandoff!” The other repeated
the words in an amazed tone.
“Can it really be you? How came
you here? You, who were sent to
Siberia. I heard about it—it was
unjust, tyrannical!”</p>

<p>Both were silent for an instant,
thinking of the time when they had
last met in one of the aristocratic
clubs of St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said Dupont, “what
does this mean?”</p>

<p>Briefly Sandoff recounted the story
of his escape, and when he paused,
pale and agitated, Maurice Dupont
took both his hands in his and held
them there.</p>

<p>“Your troubles are over, my old
friend,” he said, with tears in his
eyes. “Tonight, as soon as it is
dark, come down to the shore. You
will find a boat there with one of
my men in it, and once safely on my
yacht I defy the Czar himself to take
you off. You must be careful, though,
for a Russian corvette is lying at
anchor near me, watching for a
couple of poor devils who escaped
in a boat from the convict island of
Saghalien last week. In fact, one of
the Russian officers came out with
me today. He is somewhere at hand
now, with a couple of my men. You
see I have been wintering in Vladivostok,
and came up here a day or
two ago for a little sport before
starting for <i>la belle France</i>—but stop!
I hear footsteps. Keep yourself and
your companions well hidden, Sandoff,
and as soon as it is dark make
your way to the beach. You will
find the boat opposite my yacht,
which you can identify by the red
lantern in the bow. Quick! They
are coming.”</p>

<p>The Frenchman strolled leisurely
across the glade while Sandoff darted
into the bushes and made his
way back to Shamarin and Vera
with his burden of joyful news.</p>

<p>Through the remainder of that
short afternoon the fugitives lay concealed
among the rocks on the summit
of the ridge, and when darkness
came they crept cautiously down to
the edge of the bay. Less than a
mile from shore lay the steam yacht
Grenelle, easily distinguished by the
red light that swung from its bow.</p>

<p>“If your friend fails to keep his
word, we are lost,” said Shamarin.
“He may hesitate to assume such a
risk——”</p>

<p>“He won’t hesitate and he won’t
fail,” interrupted Sandoff with decision.
“There! What is that now?”</p>

<p>“A boat!” cried Vera joyously,
and so indeed it was. It lay upon
the beach, and as the fugitives drew
near a man advanced to meet them—a
middle aged bearded sailor,
wearing the blue and white uniform
of the Grenelle. He bowed politely
to Sandoff and said, “The boat is
waiting, monsieur. I fear we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
have a rough passage, for the surf
is heavy and the wind is rising.”</p>

<p>“Then the sooner we start the
better,” said Sandoff, answering the
sailor in his own tongue.</p>

<p>The boat was small, and without
difficulty it was dragged down to
the edge of the surf with Vera seated
in the stern. The three men
pushed the craft out through the surf.
Then they sprang in, and Sandoff
and the sailor fell to the oars, Vera
and her brother meanwhile bailing
out the water that had been flung
over the sides.</p>

<p>“Pull with all your strength, my
friend,” said Sandoff. “It will be no
easy matter to gain the yacht.”</p>

<p>The wind was blowing toward the
shore. Each moment it seemed to
increase in violence, and the sea to
grow more turbulent. After a period
of steady rowing Sandoff noted with
alarm that the boat was being carried
in the direction of the Russian
corvette. Again and again it was
headed for the crimson wake of the
lantern, and each time the waves
buffeted it persistently out of its
course. Shamarin relieved Sandoff
at the oar, but with no better result.
The situation was becoming alarming.
The sky was overcast with dark,
murky clouds, and the waves tossed
the frail craft about at will.</p>

<p>Suddenly a ruddy blaze was seen
on the beach. Then a rocket with a
luminous blue wake whizzed high in
the air, and before the fugitives
could recover from their surprise a
similar signal was sent up from the
deck of the corvette.</p>

<p>“We have been tracked to the
shore,” cried Sandoff. “The Cossacks
must have come up from
Vladivostok, and now they are signaling
to the corvette either to be
on the lookout or to send a boat in.”</p>

<p>“Most likely the latter,” said
Shamarin. “Look! Lights are
moving on deck, and I can hear the
rattling of chains.”</p>

<p>The possibility of recapture when
safety was so near at hand dismayed
the fugitives. The boat was in a
dangerous position, being directly
between the corvette and the shore.</p>

<p>“We may be saved yet,” cried
Sandoff hoarsely. “Pull straight for
the yacht—pull as you never pulled
in your lives. It is our last chance.”</p>

<p>The men tugged desperately at the
oars, and to such purpose that the
boat made visible headway toward
the Grenelle. A shout for help
might have brought another boat to
the rescue, but as it could have been
heard with equal distinctness on
board the corvette this expedient was
out of the question.</p>

<p>Another mishap was close at hand.
As the sailor pulled desperately at
his oar, it split with a sharp crack.
In the momentary confusion that
followed, the boat swung broadside
to the waves, and a fierce blast of
wind coming up at that instant, over
it went in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>Sandoff, being on the leeward side,
shot out and downward, going clear
under the icy water and coming to
the surface a few seconds later, to
find the capsized boat half a dozen
feet from him. To the bow clung
Shamarin, submerged to the breast,
while the sailor had managed to
crawl upon the stern. Vera was not
to be seen, and as Sandoff made this
terrible discovery his heart seemed
to stand still and his chilled limbs to
lose their power.</p>

<p>“Victor! Victor! Help me!”</p>

<p>His name was called in feeble
accents, and he saw a head and an
arm floating in the waves between
him and the boat.</p>

<p>All else was instantly forgotten.
With three powerful strokes he
reached the spot, and placed one
arm tightly about the girl’s waist,
while with the other he beat the
water furiously.</p>

<p>“I will save you, I will save you,
Vera—my darling!” he whispered
hoarsely. The words came unbidden
from his very soul. This moment of
common peril had wrung from his
lips the confession of a passion that
he had cherished in secret for
months.</p>

<p>The wind forced the boat down
toward him, and throwing up his
arm he caught the keel and clung
there, pressing his precious burden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
close to his side. Slowly the space
between the yacht and the boat
widened. They were drifting nearer
and nearer to the long, black hull of
the Russian corvette.</p>

<p>“Better to die now than go back
to the mines—back to torture and a
living death,” whispered Shamarin
across the boat. “Good by, Sandoff.
I can’t hold on much longer.”</p>

<p>Sandoff could not reply. His own
strength was failing, and a deadly
numbness was stealing his senses
away. The heroic sailor remained
mute, faithful to his trust, though a
single cry would have brought rescuers
to the spot.</p>

<p>Suddenly the quick, sharp rattle of
oars was heard. The sound came
nearer and nearer, and finally a dim
object passed close to the drifting
boat. It was the gig from the
corvette, speeding toward the shore.</p>

<p>As the dreaded object disappeared
in the gloom, Sandoff still held to the
keel, though his arm seemed to be
tearing from the socket. With the
other arm he fiercely drew Vera to
his breast until her cheek was almost
touching his.</p>

<p>“I love you, I love you!” he cried
passionately. “I tell you now, Vera,
in the presence of death. Would that
God had seen fit to spare us for
another and a better life in a land
without tyranny and oppression!
But regrets are vain. It is sweeter
to die this way together than to be
torn apart and dragged back to the
horrors of Siberia.”</p>

<p>His eyes met hers, and he read in
their swift, mute glance the echo of
his own words.</p>

<p>With one hand she drew his head
down. “Victor,” she whispered, “you
have made death sweet. Its bitterness
is gone.” Then their lips met, and
as the waves thundered around them
Sandoff felt his hand slipping from
the boat.</p>

<p>A low cry from the sailor roused
him, and unconsciously his fingers
tightened anew on the keel. The
spot where Shamarin had been was
empty—the brave fellow had gone
down. For him there was an end
of toil and suffering.</p>

<p>Again that low cry! The seaman
was kneeling on the capsized craft,
staring ahead through the gloom.
“A boat! a boat!” he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>“He is mad,” thought Sandoff.
“He sees no boat,” but even as he
strained Vera to his breast and felt
the icy waters rising higher around
him, a dark object shot forward over
the waves, and a voice cried, “Sandoff!
Sandoff!”</p>

<p>The next instant he and his burden
were snatched from the icy waters,
and then remembrance left him.</p>

<p>When his senses returned, he was
lying, warm and comfortable, in a
snug berth on board the Grenelle.
As in a dream he saw kind faces
about him and heard Maurice Dupont’s
voice:</p>

<p>“Sandoff, my dear fellow, you are
safe now. The yacht is already
under way. We are bound for
France. It was providence that
guided us when we started out to
search for you in the other boat.
We arrived just in time—but too
late to save your companion. The
brave fellow had gone down.”</p>

<p>Sandoff made an effort to rise.
“Vera, where is she?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Safe, my dear fellow, safe and
well. You will see her tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Sandoff smiled and his eyes closed.
He was sleeping peacefully.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Toward the end of the following
June the Grenelle entered the harbor
of Marseilles, and Sandoff and Vera
journeyed by rail to Paris, accompanied
by Maurice Dupont.</p>

<p>But little more remains to be told.
Vera and Sandoff were married in
Paris, where both had friends, and
the honeymoon was spent in Maurice
Dupont’s villa at Asnieres. They
will never return to Russia, nor have
they any desire to do so. They live
happily in their adopted country,
but if they are spared to the extreme
limit of old age they can never forget
the terrible adventures they
shared together when escaping from
the mines of Kara, or that memorable
night off the Siberian coast when
poor Felix Shamarin lost his life in
the sea he toiled so hard to reach.</p>

<h3>FROM WEEKLY TO MAGAZINE.</h3>

<p>In the issue of the 18th of August, <span class="smcap">Munsey’s
Weekly</span> announced that thereafter
that publication would be issued monthly
and in magazine form, instead of weekly,
and that the name would accordingly be
changed to <span class="smcap">Munsey’s Magazine</span>. This departure
has been made in the belief that
the <span class="smcap">Magazine</span> will furnish broader scope
for serious work than the <span class="smcap">Weekly</span>, that its
ample pages and higher grade of art will
remove it to a more desirable distance from
the daily press, which with its illustrations
and its great Sunday issues has, to a very
great extent, usurped the position once
held by the illustrated weekly journals of
this country.</p>

<p>Now that the transition from <span class="smcap">Weekly</span> to
<span class="smcap">Magazine</span> is accomplished it will be the
purpose of the management to make <span class="smcap">Munsey’s
Magazine</span> a publication of the best
grade—one that shall be strong in illustration,
instructive in its heavier articles and
entertaining in its fiction. Life is a necessary
condition of growth, and as we now
have life so shall growth follow—growth
in everything that goes to round out a
magazine in whatever approaches the
ideal.</p>

<h3>OUR IMMIGRANT ARMIES.</h3>

<p>“Hundreds of thousands of able bodied
immigrants arriving in our ports every
year! What a tremendous addition to the
wealth and prosperity of the country!”</p>

<p>“Hundreds of thousands of penniless
immigrants arriving in our ports every
year! No wonder that in the American
labor market competition grows fiercer and
fiercer!”</p>

<p>Here we have two expressions of opinion
that may be heard every day, and that
give diametrically opposite views of one of
the most familiar and important facts of
the day. Which of the two is correct? Is
the arrival of a foreigner, whose sole capital
is his ability to labor, a benefit or an injury
to the country? It is surely time that the
question should be definitely decided in the
popular mind. The annual influx of about
half a million foreigners cannot but have a
tremendous effect upon the industrial,
social and political development of the
country. If its effect is beneficial, then the
influx should be encouraged and even
stimulated; if injurious, it should be regulated
and restricted.</p>

<p>The question is one for political economists
and statesmen. Politicians of the
ordinary sort will no doubt prefer to let it
severely alone. It was indeed raised as a
political issue by the defunct Knownothing
party, but the shape in which it was presented,
and the answer that it met, belong to
a past generation. We have to deal with
the subject anew, and at a more advanced
point in our national history. Our condition,
our needs, and our dangers are widely
different from those of our predecessors, and
changed circumstances may require altered
policies.</p>

<p>Few will question the truth of the axiom
that the great need of a new country is industrious
immigrants. In the youth of the
American commonwealth, its pioneers
found themselves possessed of a vast
continent of almost boundless natural resources,
upon whose eastern edge a handful
of scanty population was scattered.
Had immigration ceased at the beginning
of the present century, the development
of those resources would have been incalculably
retarded. This would be today a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
comparatively small, weak and indigent
nation—more closely resembling, perhaps,
the Canada of today than the United
States of today.</p>

<p>So much for the past. Now for the
future. Do not common sense and experience
show that communities, like individuals,
must have their birth, their
adolescence, and their maturity? And
must there not come a time in their development
when accessions to their numbers
are rather a burden than an aid? We
have all heard of over populated countries,
and it is not necessary to be a follower of
Malthus to recognize that while population
tends to multiply in an ever increasing
ratio, there must always be a limit to the
means of subsistence. That we are within
measurable distance of such a limit we do
not maintain; that we are advancing toward
it cannot be denied.</p>

<p>Take England as an example of a
country in the state of social and industrial
development that we are approaching.
She is old and crowded with population.
Her resources have been exploited, her
railroads have been built, her canals have
been dug. Her industries are of course
vast in extent, but their expansion becomes
more and more difficult, and it grows
harder and harder to find employment for
the increasing hosts who demand work.
If it were proposed to bring into England,
from some other country, a hundred
thousand, or even a thousand, penniless
laborers, what a unanimous outcry would
be raised against the inexpediency of such
action! The vehemence with which the
idea would be opposed may be judged from
the uneasiness and even indignation
already excited there by the gathering in
London of a colony, comparatively insignificant
in numbers, of immigrants from
Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>The condition of the United States is
still very different from that of England.
She has over five hundred inhabitants to
the square mile—we have but twenty.
There are still fertile plains in the West
that have not felt the plow, and lodes of
ore in our mountains awaiting the miner’s
pick. We have still great resources to develop.
But there evidently is a point in a
country’s history at which foreign immigration,
once vitally beneficial, becomes injurious.
The question that calls for earnest
discussion and speedy settlement is
whether we are now approaching that
point—whether we have not already arrived
there.</p>

<h3>RULING OUT ART.</h3>

<p>In their dealings with Art, Congress and
the Treasury Department have not been
fortunate. The legislative and executive
authorities at Washington seem to think
that the great and glorious principle of
protection to American industries demands
the exclusion or heavy taxation of every
product of foreign art. The Treasury
recently distinguished itself by issuing an
order that all engravings, etchings, and
photographs found in the mails from abroad
should be confiscated. Under this ruling
an American traveling or residing in
Europe cannot mail a photograph to his
relatives at home. An immigrant from
Ireland or Germany cannot receive the
likeness of his mother or sister in the “old
country” unless it is sent him by an express
company and through the custom
house, whose expenses and delays are
almost prohibitory.</p>

<p>It may be gathered from the preceding
article that we believe in the exercise of
the government’s powers for the encouragement
of American industries and the protection
of American labor. We are also
patriotic enough to think that America is a
civilized country, and that a policy of
hostility to foreign art is unworthy of her.
Art knows no international boundaries and
is not a mere matter of dollars and cents.
Even if it were, the prohibition or restriction
of importations would make us poorer
and not richer. Inspection of representative
work from abroad is in a hundred ways
beneficial to our own educational, artistic,
and mechanical advancement. All this has
been so fully and frequently pointed out,
that we may hope some day to see it
recognized in our fiscal system. The McKinley
bill did indeed take a step in the
right direction by reducing the duty on
paintings and statuary from thirty to fifteen
per cent ad valorem, leaving the tariff upon
photographs, etchings, and all kinds of
prints at twenty five per cent. It is difficult
to see why the arguments that led
Congress to cut off one half the tax upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
paintings should not apply with equal force
to the abolition of the other half. The
Treasury order excluding photographs
from the mails is surely oppressive enough
to excite forcible protests. It is true that the
ruling is in strict accordance with the letter
of the law, which had previously been in
abeyance. The annoyances—individually
trifling, perhaps, but collectively serious—that
its enforcement will cause, may result
in strengthening the demand for the liberation
of art from the customs officials.</p>

<h3>DEFECTS IN OUR PENAL CODE.</h3>

<p>Nineteenth century ingenuity has identified
and christened the science of penology,
but has hitherto failed to make any
thorough application of its principles. The
practical side of the matter is indeed in a
state of partial chaos. Take, for instance,
the various contemporary methods of dealing
with homicides. England hangs them,
France guillotines them, Spain garottes
them, New York invokes electrical
science to slay them with artificial lightning.
The great West takes them without
any tiresome legal process and suspends
them upon the nearest tree. And meanwhile
the best thought of the day seems to
be turning toward the opinion that capital
punishment in any form is unjust and
inexpedient.</p>

<p>Another anomaly in existing penal systems
is their failure to deal adequately with
the chronic “jail bird”—the man whose inveterate
tendency to crime breaks out again
and again, with only such enforced intervals
as may be imposed by periodical incarcerations.
Such cases are, unfortunately,
far from rare. For instance, the
daily press last month recorded a fiendish
plot to rob and murder an aged couple in a
Long Island village. Of the two conspirators,
one had spent a total of seventeen
years in prison as the result of a series of
convictions for similar offenses, while the
other—a lad of eighteen—had just finished
a term of imprisonment for a previous
attempt to murder.</p>

<p>At almost the same time a miscreant
made an effort, which narrowly missed
success, to blow up a crowded train on the
Lehigh Valley railroad by placing dynamite
on the track. Investigation of his antecedents
revealed that most of his life had
been passed in jail, to which he had been
repeatedly sentenced for a variety of more
or less serious crimes, among which was an
attempt to destroy a Hudson River passenger
steamboat. For his last offense he was
tried, convicted, and sentenced to ten
years’ imprisonment. With the usual commutations,
his term will probably expire in
five or six years, when we may expect him
to renew his attacks upon his fellow men.</p>

<p>The dual purpose of the penal law is, we
take it, the reformation of the criminal and
the protection of society. Now in the cases
cited, and in scores of similar ones, it is
entirely clear that repeated terms of imprisonment
have not the slightest corrective
or deterrent effect upon the offender, while
they afford only a temporary safeguard to
the community upon which he preys. As
soon as he is released from jail, his perverted
mental bent impels him to resume
his warfare against mankind. It is mere
fatuity to give such a man his liberty,
when liberty simply means another opportunity
to attack the lives or property of
others. And yet, under existing laws, he
is again and again set loose to resume his
predatory career. There is no statute
under which his incurable hostility to
society can be rendered innocuous by imprisonment
for life. And yet it is evident
that such is the only rational method of
dealing with a large number of cases.</p>
